<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This little book does not claim to be a comprehensive
treatise on the art of cataloguing books, nor is it intended
for the use of the expert in bibliography. The rules embodied
are those generally recognized as necessary for the
proper cataloguing of a collection of books. By simple
illustrations the author has endeavoured to deal with those
difficulties which he has found most frequently arise and
call for careful consideration. Information concerning the
printing of catalogues has been added in order to make
the book more complete.</p>

<p>If this Manual should prove a help to the better
understanding of the true principles of cataloguing, and
is found to be of practical assistance to those engaged in
library work, the object of its compilation will have been
attained.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY.</span></h2>

<p id="sec1"><b>1.</b>&mdash;Most people are satisfied to believe that there is no
department of a librarian’s work so easily managed as that
of compiling catalogues. The catalogue of a library is
often regarded as a mere list of books, calling for no more
mental effort in its production than is required in that of a
furniture auctioneer, or similar trade list. Professor John
Fiske, in his essay on “A Librarian’s Work,”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says
“Generally I find a library catalogue is assumed to be a
thing that is somehow ‘made’ at a single stroke, as
Aladdin’s palace was built, at intervals of ten or a dozen
years, or whenever a ‘new catalogue’ is thought to be
needed,” instead of, as he proceeds to show, being a never-ending
work calling for the exercise of all the power and
knowledge at the command of the cataloguer.</p>

<p id="sec2"><b>2.</b>&mdash;There are varieties of library catalogues, from the
simple inventories made by private persons for their own
collection of books, to the mammoth “Catalogue of Printed
Books in the British Museum,” so great in its size and extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in the field it covers that its entries have to be
almost exclusively limited to a single item for each book.</p>

<p>The catalogues to be compiled upon the lines laid down
in this work come between these two extremes, and are
intended to serve as a key to the treasure-house of knowledge
and disclose its contents in a ready, but orderly,
manner to all inquirers. Carlyle says, “a big collection
of books, without a good catalogue, is a Polyphemus
with no eye in his head.”</p>

<p id="sec3"><b>3.</b>&mdash;A good library is virtually useless without an adequate
and properly compiled catalogue, but even an indifferent
collection of books can be made to render good service
by means of a good catalogue. In order to compile such
a catalogue it is necessary that certain particulars be given
descriptive of the books, but in such a way that, while the
entries afford all needful information to the person well-versed
in books, they shall at the same time be so simple
in character as to be understood with very little effort by
anyone of average intelligence. At the same time the
particulars given should be so comprehensive that a
searcher in the catalogue may be able to obtain a clear
idea of the nature and scope of the book described without
actually examining it, though the descriptions in this respect
are not expected to be of the very full order looked for in
special bibliographies intended only for the use of experts.</p>

<p>The value of a good catalogue does not depend upon its
extent or size any more than does a good book, but rather
upon the exactness of the method by which the information
given is digested and concentrated. There are library
catalogues so elaborately compiled that they are most imposing
in appearance, and very often, as a consequence, are
considered to be most erudite productions by those who do
not understand the art of cataloguing, whereas the persons
who have to use them too often find out that they are so
ill-arranged as to be little better than a hotch-potch of book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
titles&mdash;pedantic without being learned. “Infinite riches in
a little room” might, on the other hand, be often adopted
as the motto for many an insignificant-looking catalogue.</p>

<p id="sec4"><b>4.</b>&mdash;It is a common occurrence to find a small library with
quite a big catalogue. This does not always arise from the
wish to make the most of the library, but often from the
fact that the compilation has been undertaken by some
over-zealous member of a committee who fancied he had
a <i>penchant</i> for such work, or that it has been compiled by
an amateur with no experience, whose friends have secured
him his appointment as librarian. Such people do not
know that it is as easy, if not easier, to over-catalogue a
library as to do it judiciously, and a fearful and wonderful
work is often the result. There would not be much
trouble in giving illustrative examples of this, but that
catalogue may be cited where Green’s “Short History of the
English People” obtained five entries, viz., under Green,
Short, History, English History, and People (English),
instead of the two entries that would have sufficed. Many
of the first catalogues of the smaller free libraries are of
this order. This, however, is not always the result of the
above-named causes, but as often as not is brought about
by committees of new libraries postponing the appointment
of a librarian, to save his salary, until a few weeks before
the library is announced to be opened, and then expecting
him to purchase the books and produce a printed catalogue
in the meantime. The conception of the matter is,
far too often, that books can be selected, arranged, and
listed in bulk, as groceries are bought, displayed, and
ticketed, and in as short a time. The result, of course, is
that the librarian, being rushed, must select and buy the
books as quickly as he can, and relegate the work of cataloguing
them to an assistant, who most likely has no training,
and the best has to be made of a bad job. In very
few instances can it be considered that the first catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of a new library fairly represents the ability of the librarian
as a cataloguer.</p>

<p id="sec5"><b>5.</b>&mdash;With the rapid rise of the standard of education
more exact and better work is at present demanded in
libraries than was the case during the first quarter of a
century after the Public Libraries’ Act came into operation.
The slipshod rule-of-thumb cataloguing at one time in
vogue does not pass muster unnoticed now, as it did then,
and consequently there is less use than ever before for the
bald lists of books, compiled upon no principle in particular,
sent forth to bewilder and hinder rather than help
an inquiring public. The student, and that interesting personage,
“the general reader,” are each year coming to a better
understanding of the uses and peculiarities of books, and
so look for more precise information concerning them. No
better evidence is needed of the manner in which the demand
for information about books has grown than is found
in the large place which the reviewing of them now takes
in the columns of the newspaper press, so that even minor
journals cannot afford to ignore it. The dictum that a
cataloguer has no right to go behind the information
contained on the title-page of a book does not now find
acceptance, as it did in the past.</p>

<p>Those persons who are possessed of even a little
experience in the matter know that it is impossible to compile
a catalogue in a hap-hazard fashion, and that clear and
definite rules must be laid down before any part of the
work is attempted, otherwise confusion and want of proportion
will result. Happily of late years the rules
governing the proper compilation of catalogues have been
codified, particularly those for the form at present in most
general use, known as the “dictionary catalogue.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DICTIONARY CATALOGUE.</span></h2>

<p id="sec6"><b>6.</b>&mdash;The dictionary catalogue is not the idea or invention
of any individual, but has developed gradually from the
requirements of librarians in dealing with readers. The
earlier catalogues were limited to entries given under the
authors’ names, as in the British Museum Catalogue, or
were in classified form, either under the large classes into
which a library was divided, or with very little other sub-division.
These were followed by what may be termed
“dictionary index catalogues” containing the first principles
of the dictionary catalogue as now understood. They
consisted of very brief entries under authors, and the
simple turning about of a title to bring a certain word in
it to the front as conveying its subject, in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>England under Victoria. Michelsen.</p>

<p>Englefield (Sir H. C.) Walk through Southampton.</p>

<p>English Antiquities. Eccleston. 1847.</p>

<p>Ennui. Edgeworth.</p>

<p>Entomology, Exotic. Drury. 1837.</p>

<p>Episodes of Insect Life. 1851.</p>

<p>Errand to the South. Malet.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">By this method the real subject of the book was often
missed, more especially if the author had made use of a
fanciful title, and one subject would be found under many
different entries, according to the word used on the title-page,
and without cross references to bind them together.
It must be confessed that to-day many of the dictionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
catalogues of public libraries are no more than this “index
catalogue” under the newer name. The entries may be a
little fuller, but the principles of compilation remain the
same.</p>

<p id="sec7"><b>7.</b>&mdash;Prior to 1876 there was no complete code of rules
for the preparation of a subject as well as author catalogue,
though Prof. C. C. Jewett’s “On the construction
of Catalogues of Libraries” (Washington, 1853), with
its subsequent modifications, was a step in this direction.
There were rules for author catalogues, for
the most part based upon the British Museum rules, as
well as schemes of classification for classified catalogues.
In that year was published the now well-known “Rules for
a Dictionary Catalogue,” by Charles A. Cutter, Librarian
of the Boston Athenæum. It appeared as the second part
of the “Special Report on the Public Libraries in the
United States of America,” issued under the auspices of
the United States Bureau of Education. A second
edition of these rules was separately issued in 1889.
The third edition, with further corrections and additions,
appeared in 1891, and has been most liberally distributed
by the United States Government to the libraries of the
world. Since 1876 other rules have been formulated,
principally with Cutter’s as a basis. A consensus of these
will be found in the “Eclectic Card Catalog Rules,
Author and Title Entries,” by K. A. Linderfelt, Librarian
of the Milwaukee Public Library, Boston (Charles A.
Cutter) 1890. This most useful compilation, “based on
Dziatzko’s ‘Instruction’ compared with the rules of
the British Museum, Cutter, Dewey, Perkins, and other
authorities,” is not as well known to English librarians
as it should be. The present Manual is intended to
serve as an introduction to these two codes, and the instructions
contained in it are based upon them. When these
have not been adhered to the changes made have obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
authority in library practice. Mr. Henry B. Wheatley’s
interesting little book, “How to Catalogue a Library”
(Stock, 1889), must also be mentioned, and should be read
as an introduction to the subject.</p>

<p id="sec8"><b>8.</b>&mdash;The great merit of the dictionary catalogue is that it
can be made to supply most of the information usually
asked for by those using libraries, and by immediate reference
without any preliminary study of its arrangement. It
obtains its name from the circumstance that all the entries,
irrespective of their nature, are put into a single alphabetical
sequence, and consulted as one would consult a
dictionary. It is considered to be the most acceptable
form to the majority of those making use of popular
libraries, and experience has proved it to be so.</p>

<p>The dictionary catalogue is intended to answer all of the
following questions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What books are contained in the library by a given
author, as, Hall Caine? The answer to this is
called the <i>author-entry</i>.</p>

<p>What books have you upon a specific subject, as the
dynamo; or upon a particular topic, as the Eastern
question? The entries answering such enquiries
are the <i>subject-entries</i>.</p>

<p>Have you a book called, “A Daughter of Eve?” The
entry supplying this information would be the <i>title-entry</i>.</p>

<p>Have you any volume of a series, as, “English men of
letters?” This it will also answer, and the reply
may be termed the <i>series-entry</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>There are questions, however, that the dictionary
catalogue does not ordinarily answer. It would not
tell what books were in the library in a particular
language, say French, and it will not provide a complete
and definite list of books in a particular <i>form</i>, as fiction,
or poetry; or in a <i>class</i> of literature as distinct from <i>subject</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
For example, it will not group together all the theological
works, or the scientific books, but will distribute them
throughout the entire alphabet, according to the divisions
of these subjects, and these divisions will in their turn
be distributed according to lesser divisions and monographs.</p>

<p>A catalogue compiled upon the lines requisite to group
such classes completely, so that a general treatise and a
monograph upon a minute division will follow in natural
order, would be a classified catalogue, and that form is
dealt with separately in Chapter XII.</p>

<p>To effect a combination of both forms in such a way that
they would answer any question, reasonable or otherwise,
would necessitate so large a number of entries for each
book that its compilation would be barely feasible, and if
carried out it would be unsatisfactory, because the simplicity
of the alphabetical order would be destroyed, and the
result would not be worth the labour expended, to say
nothing of its size and costliness.</p>

<p id="sec9"><b>9.</b>&mdash;Therefore choice must be made at the very outset
between the two forms, dictionary or classified. The point
to be first considered is, which form is most likely to best
suit the needs of the particular class who use the library;
as a catalogue which would be most useful for a college
library, or that of a scientific society, would be unsuitable
for a free library in the midst of a working-class population.
Then the question of cost enters into the matter, and here
the classified form has the advantage, as apart from the brief
index entries, one entry per book mostly suffices, whereas in
the dictionary form the average is three entries. There is a
still more important matter which materially affects the
older libraries, and that is the impossibility of keeping the
dictionary form within reasonable compass, even with
curtailed entries and closely-printed pages of small type.
Borrowers from a public lending library prefer to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
their catalogues with them when exchanging books, but
they cannot do so if it is in two or three volumes, or so
bulky as not to be portable. For this reason librarians
with unbounded belief in the superior advantages of the
dictionary catalogue have been compelled, against their
will, to adopt the classified form. They had no alternative,
except the very unsatisfactory one of extensively weeding
their stock of books, and only those who have undertaken
that responsibility know how difficult it is to decide
whether a book is worth retaining or not. A very
judicial statement of the merits of the two styles of catalogues
will be found in a paper by Mr. F. T. Barrett, of
the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, entitled “The Alphabetical
and Classified Forms of Catalogues Compared,” in the
“Transactions of the Second International Library Conference,”
1897. Mr. J. D. Brown’s views, as set forth in
Chapter v. of his “Manual of Library Classification”
(Library Supply Co., 1898), should also be carefully
considered.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARIES.</h3>

<p id="sec10"><b>10.</b>&mdash;Presuming that the student is for the first time
undertaking the work of cataloguing a library, he will
require to provide himself with a supply of cards or slips of
paper cut uniform in size. Almost any size will do, but
the most convenient and more commonly used measures
5 inches by 3 inches. If the catalogue is to be written
for the use of readers, then cards are necessary as they are
more convenient for turning over than the paper slips
which serve well enough for “copy” for a printed catalogue.
If the cards or slips are to be written upon with a pen they
should be ruled “feint” across and have marginal rulings
to mark the “indent.” These rulings are only upon one
side, as in no case should an entry be continued to the
other side. If an entry is so long that it cannot be put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
one card then it must be continued on the face of a second,
with the author or other heading repeated. For the
cataloguer’s own use or as printer’s copy, the card or slip
may be lengthened as required by pasting to it a strip of
paper of the same width, and folding it up within the
compass of the size of the card, but exposing the heading.
This cannot be done when the cards are held in place by a
rod running through them. It need hardly be pointed
out that for a card catalogue meant for the use of many
persons the quality of the cards is of great importance,
as those of a cheap, inferior material will not bear much
turning over without tearing. Card catalogues are not
invariably appreciated by the public, as some persons seem
to experience difficulty in turning over the cards. For this
reason some librarians prefer the sheaf form because it
maintains the book shape, which everyone understands,
and it has the same advantages as the card catalogue in
allowing the insertion of additions in proper order at any
time, and permits unlimited expansion, besides taking up
less room.</p>

<p>Upon each card or slip a separate entry of each book
is made, and by “book” is meant a work that may be
in a single volume or in many volumes. Two works even
by the same author, appearing under his name, should be
entered on separate cards, as, if written together, it is
usually found that another book will later have to be
inserted <i>between</i> them.</p>

<p id="sec11"><b>11.</b>&mdash;Printers are acknowledged, as a class, to be the most
exact and patient of men, but to those beginners who
have not any large experience of their ways it is well to say
“be careful to write boldly and plainly,” remembering
always that it is a much more difficult work for a compositor
to set a catalogue than probably any other form of
book, because the matter does not “run on” and various
types and languages commonly enter into it. Apart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the mistakes easily made when the “copy,” as the manuscript
is called, is not clear and distinct, there is the risk
incurred of an extra charge for “author’s corrections”&mdash;a
well-known item in all printers’ bills. To write clearly is of
even more importance if the catalogue is to remain in
manuscript for use by readers. A handy little brochure
upon this subject is “Library Handwriting,” issued by
the New York State Library School, April 1898, and the
style of handwriting therein shown should be studied
and imitated. The specimen on the next page is taken
from it.</p>

<p id="sec12"><b>12.</b>&mdash;It is in the preparation of “copy” and in writing
card catalogues for public use that the great value of the
typewriter is experienced, as clearness and uniformity are
insured by its use as well as economy of space. While it is
hardly within the scope of this Manual to say anything by
way of recommendation of any particular make of typewriter,
yet experience shows that it would be a mistake to
overlook the “Hammond” when considering the merits of
different machines. In cataloguing it is found useful because
a variety of types of a distinctive character, including
the accented letters most commonly required, can be used
upon a single machine.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRINCIPAL ENTRY.&mdash;THE AUTHOR ENTRY, I.</span></h2>

<p id="sec13"><b>13.</b>&mdash;Whatever difference of opinion may exist upon
various points that arise in cataloguing books all authorities
are agreed that the principal or main entry giving the most
particulars concerning a book should be that under its
author’s name. This, then, is the first entry to be made,
and the cataloguer having selected the book to be dealt
with ignores any title upon the binding and, passing by the
preliminary, or “half title,” turns to the title page proper,
that containing the most information and with the imprint
(place of publication, publisher, and date) at foot, and
copies from it the following particulars, adding those not
given upon the title-page by an examination of the book,
and in this order, viz.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The author’s surname.</p>

<p>2. The author’s Christian name (or prenom).</p>

<p>3. Titles of the author (when required for distinctive
or distinguishing purposes).</p>

<p>4. The title of the book.</p>

<p>5. The editor’s name (if not the author or compiler)
or the translator’s name (if to be given).</p>

<p>6. The edition.</p>

<p>7. The name of series (if any), or, if part of a book,
the name of the book it is contained in.</p>

<p>8. The collation (if to be given), or</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>9. The number of volumes, when more than one.</p>

<p>10. The size (if to be given).</p>

<p>11. The place of publication.</p>

<p>12. The place of printing or name of printer (when
the book is typographically interesting only).</p>

<p>13. The date of publication.</p>

<p>14. The shelf, press, or other location or finding
mark.</p>

<p>15. Descriptive or explanatory note (when thought
desirable).</p>

<p>16. Contents (if set out).</p>

</div>

<p>The order is that most usually adopted, but Nos. 8 to 13
may be varied at pleasure, if such variation is made at the
commencement of the work and adhered to in all cases
afterwards.</p>

<p id="sec14"><b>14.</b>&mdash;As the surname of the author leads, the Christian
name must follow, either enclosed in parentheses, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dickens (Charles),</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">or preceded by a comma, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Emerson, Ralph Waldo.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The parentheses are more commonly used, but they have
not so good an appearance as the comma, and their use
necessitates what a printer calls “a run on sorts”&mdash;that is
the use of a particular piece of type to such an extent as
to require a special supply beyond that ordinarily furnished
with a fount of type. This, after all, resolves
itself more into a question of taste than of expediency, and
the cataloguer will choose as he thinks best. It may be
remarked in passing that the “cult of the trivial” is not
to be altogether despised in cataloguing, as careful attention
to apparently minor details ensures good and exact
work.</p>

<p id="sec15"><b>15.</b>&mdash;The points to be observed in copying the title-page
and preparing the author-entry can be shown more
clearly by illustration than by description. Let it be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that the title-page of the book in hand reads in full:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Personal History of David Copperfield. By
Charles Dickens. With eight illustrations. London:
Chapman &amp; Hall, Piccadilly.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">We proceed to write the principal entry to read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dickens, Charles. The personal history of David
Copperfield.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">From the “fly-title” we learn that this is the “Charles
Dickens’ edition.” We examine the book, and find it
contains six prefatory pages, these being paged in Roman
numerals, and 533 others paged in Arabic, with a portrait
and seven other illustrations. This statement of the number
of pages and illustrations is known as the “collation,”
as to examine a book for the purpose of ascertaining that
it is perfect is to collate it. As the place of publication
is London, it is the practice in English catalogues to omit
it from the entry, such omission signifying that London is
understood. The date of publication not being given, and
as there are no means of finding it out with certainty, the
initials “n.d.,” meaning “no date,” are added, and the
full catalogue entry will be:</p>

<div class="card-sample">

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">DICKENS, Charles.</span></p>

<p class="entry">The personal history of David
Copperfield. (<i>Charles Dickens’
ed.</i>) pp. vi., 533, port., illus.
8vo. n.d.</p>

<p class="press-mark">K 1200</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The author’s name should be written at the outside left
hand of the card at the top, the rest of the entry following
with an indent at each side, the press mark alone coming
outside at the right hand, as shown in the printed entry
above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec16"><b>16.</b>&mdash;It is of the utmost importance that care be taken
in transcribing a title, as it is much easier to make a
mistake than to detect it afterwards, even at the time of
printing. Errors of the hand and of the eye creep in imperceptibly.
Besides, a mistake having once been made is
likely to be repeated in all other entries, when copied from
the first one. A very common cause of error is to let the
mind become so absorbed in the consideration of a book
in hand, that when a second comes to be dealt with some
word from the first will unwittingly be written into its title,
and if the result is not very obvious from its absurdity it
escapes notice altogether until printed, and bears permanent
witness against the cataloguer.</p>

<p id="sec17"><b>17.</b>&mdash;The signs and abbreviations of words made use of
in the above illustration, and all others to follow, are those
customary in cataloguing, and as there is a number of well-understood
abbreviations used in connection with books, a
list of the most useful of these is given in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>It is a commendable plan to take note of those it is intended
to use, and to keep a list of them written on a card
always at hand for reference. The list could then be put
in the preface to the catalogue when printed, as a help to
its better understanding by those not versed in book
abbreviations. It is as well to remember that there is not
very much gained in the long run by abbreviating too
closely, as “illus.” is easier understood than “il.” or “ill.”
and “transl.” than “tr.”</p>

<p id="sec18"><b>18.</b>&mdash;In copying a title-page it is required that the
spelling of it should be closely followed, more especially if
peculiar, but not the punctuation. The punctuation in the
illustrative entries throughout this Manual is that most
frequently made use of in catalogues, and will be found
convenient in practice. But if personal preference for
other forms comes in, and a change is made, all that is
needed is that such change should be uniformly carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
out. Besides the ordinary rules of punctuation there are
but four well-defined which can be considered to govern
the matter, and these are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A.&mdash;That alternative titles take a semi-colon after the
first title, and a comma after the word “or;” as</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>St. Winifred’s; or, the world of school.</p>

</div>

<p>B.&mdash;That explanatory sub-titles be preceded by a
colon; as</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>The foundation of death: a study of the drink question.</p>

</div>

<p>C.&mdash;When additional matter in the book occupies a
subsidiary place in the title-page, in order not to
detach it altogether from the rest of the title,
that the word “with” be preceded by a semi-colon;
as</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>Life of Luther; with an account of the Reformation.</p>

</div>

<p>D.&mdash;That when an editor’s or translator’s name appears
upon the title-page the word “ed.” or “transl.”
be preceded by a semi-colon, as</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>Epictetus. Discourses; transl. by George Long.</p>

<p>Green fairy book; ed. by Andrew Lang.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is necessary to point out that in cataloguing it must not
be left to the printer to supply the punctuation, as is
customary with other books, and therefore the cataloguer
must carefully supply it as he proceeds, and not when the
time comes to prepare the work for the press.</p>

<p id="sec19"><b>19.</b>&mdash;The same rule holds good with respect to the use
of capital letters. Until recently it was the general fashion
in printing book-titles to give every word, or almost every
word, an initial capital, but the custom has fallen into
disuse. Like other old-fashioned customs it dies hard,
and if not advised that the “copy” must be closely
followed in this respect, the printer will as likely as not
put in the capitals all the same, and this in spite of the
fact that he may have to wait until he has one sheet printed
off before he can set another, on account of the run on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the capitals. All that is now expected is that capital letters
should be used in catalogue entries as they would be in any
ordinary book, viz., to proper names; to words coming after
a full stop; and to words derived from proper names. In
the last-named a lower-case (<i>i.e.</i> small) initial letter is
sometimes used in catalogues, but such words as “christian,”
“pauline,” “lutheran,” “darwinism,” “ibsenism,”
have not a good appearance and should be avoided. In
foreign titles the usage of the language should be followed,
so that there will be fewer capitals used in Latin, French,
or Italian than in English, and more in German.</p>

<p id="sec20"><b>20.</b>&mdash;All dates and numbers should be transcribed in
Arabic figures, even if they are in Roman numerals upon
the title-page. Thus, “from the XVIIth Century to the
Present Time” becomes “from the 17th century to the
present time;” “MDCCCXCIX” becomes “1899;” and
“Volume xliv.” is simply “v. 44.” The only reasonable
exception to this rule is that numbers to the names of
potentates be always in Roman, though in American
catalogues these also are put into Arabic. We on this
side of the Atlantic are not yet well enough accustomed
to “Charles 2,” or even “Edward 6th,” to adopt it.</p>

<p id="sec21"><b>21.</b>&mdash;Sometimes figures form part of the title of a book,
when it is desirable for the sake of appearance to write
them out in words: the transcript, of course, being kept
in the language of the title-page, though “50 études pour
le piano” has been seen entered in a catalogue as “Fifty
études pour le piano.”</p>

<p id="sec22"><b>22.</b>&mdash;So far as languages printed in Roman are concerned,
it is the invariable rule to adhere to the language
of the title-page, and not to make a translation. In
ordinary libraries Greek is usually transliterated into
Latin; if a Greek classic has both Greek and Latin
titles, as is commonly the case, then the Latin title is
taken rather than the Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec23"><b>23.</b>&mdash;Upon this point of the translation of title-pages
the question of utility, in popular libraries especially,
might very well be considered. It does not often happen,
but it is possible, that a person may be a capable musician
and not know a word of French, German, or Italian, and
it is likely therefore that many of the lesser-known compositions
would be made acceptable if a translation of
the title-page were given as well as the original. It is
very certain that in the public libraries there are many
valuable foreign books upon ornament and the decorative
arts, consisting almost exclusively of illustrations, that are not
used as they should be. The catalogue entries of such
books convey no meaning whatever to many an artisan or
craftsman, and a free translation might very well be given
for their benefit. If such a translation is not given, a note
descriptive of the nature of the book should be added.</p>

<p id="sec24"><b>24.</b>&mdash;It is a safe rule that the date of publication should
be given in every case and in every entry, as it serves in
some measure to show the particular edition of the book,
and more important still in scientific and technical works,
to show if the editions in a library are of recent date or
obsolete. It will, however, be found quite useless in
popular libraries to give the dates of publication in the
entries of works of fiction, for the simple reason that many
of the books in this class of literature are so often worn
out and then replaced with new copies, which are very
seldom of the same dates as those printed in the
catalogue, and it soon becomes incorrect in this respect.
Happily it is a matter of no importance, as very few fiction
readers are concerned about the date of publication, and
therefore it may be safely omitted from all entries. This
statement does not apply to first or other editions of
novels of special value, such as the first edition of
“David Copperfield,” as these would be fully described as
well as carefully preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec25"><b>25.</b>&mdash;A suggestion worthy of consideration has been made
that the original dates of publication should be added to
the entries of reprints. This would increase the information
given, and might prevent persons mistaking an old
book for a new one, though librarians are familiar with the
fact that old books are read with as much pleasure as the
newest, if got up with modern attractive illustrations and
pretty bindings.</p>

<p id="sec26"><b>26.</b>&mdash;In the illustrative entry we have marked the book
as 8vo.&mdash;that is octavo in size. This we learn either by
experience in the sizes of books, or by actual measurement,
and it may be at once admitted that the question of size
notation is a vexed one and no absolute rule can be laid
down for guidance. Those who have studied the matter
know that there is no satisfactory solution of the difficulty
beyond that of measuring the book and giving its size in
centimetres or in inches. But this encumbers the catalogue
entry too much, and for ordinary every-day purposes
the old signs suffice of 8vo. (octavo), 4to. (quarto), and fo. (folio),
and they give a rough idea of the size. These may
be qualified, if thought necessary, by la. (large), sm. (small),
or obl. (oblong), if the books are of a special size. The
terms 12ᵒ., 16ᵒ., 32ᵒ., &amp;c. are sometimes used, but they do
not convey any very precise information and the additional
terms of “demy,” “royal,” “imperial,” and others have
varying meaning nowadays, as there is no fixed standard in
the sizes of paper or books. <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a> consists of a
table taken from the “Report of the Committee on Size
Notation of the Library Association of the United
Kingdom,” and this may be studied as an introduction to
the subject, but is not to be taken as decisive. The full
report of the Committee is to be found in the Library
Association Monthly Notes, vol. 3, 1882, pp. 130-133. A
scale made from this table will be found convenient to
cataloguers, as will also the handy and better known book-size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
scale prepared by Mr. Madeley of the Warrington
Museum. The pages of books are to be measured and not
their bindings. The sizes of books are not always shown
in the printed catalogues of free libraries and if they were it
is most likely that the signs would confuse rather than help,
as the majority of the public do not understand anything
of the matter, besides the proportion of books other than
octavos is not large in a lending library. The reference
library usually contains a considerable number of quartos
and folios and the information upon this point would be
more useful in the catalogue of that department.</p>

<p id="sec27"><b>27.</b>&mdash;The immense value of occasional explanatory or
descriptive notes to the entries in a catalogue is well
known, but they are not as often inserted as they might be.
They should be added to author, subject, or title entry,
where necessary, desirable, or in any way helpful, as far as
possible briefly and to the point, and printed under the
entry in a smaller type, to show they are not part of the
title. The following are a few examples taken from various
catalogues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<span class="smaller">THE PRINCIPAL ENTRY.&mdash;THE AUTHOR ENTRY, 2.</span></h2>

<p id="sec28"><b>28.</b>&mdash;Having laid down some of the general principles to
be followed in making the author-entry in a complete form,
we proceed to take further examples selected because they
happen to be at hand and not for any difficulty they present.
Any batch of ordinary books will contain some that
are troublesome to the beginner in cataloguing, and for this
reason nothing that can be regarded as of an out-of-the-way
character has been taken in illustration.</p>

<p>The next book is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Historic survey of German poetry, interspersed
with various translations. By W. Taylor, of
Norwich. London: Treuttel, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The work is in three volumes, the first being dated 1828,
the second 1829, and the third 1830. We ascertain by
reference to a biographical dictionary, or other likely work,
that the author’s name is William, and as Wm. Taylor is a
somewhat common name we retain the description “of
Norwich,” so that he may be distinguished from any other
author of the same name. The author-entry then is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, William (<i>of Norwich</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Historic survey of German poetry, interspersed
with various translations. 3 v. 8o. 1828-30</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This book being in more than one volume a collation of
each is not given, as the statement of the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
volumes is considered to give sufficient idea of its extent.
If the work were illustrated this fact would still be stated,
not usually as “3 v., illus.” but “Illus. 3 v.” or “illus.
3 v.” It will be seen that the date of publication of
each volume is not given but the first and last dates
only. It is necessary to point out that the earliest and
latest dates are not always those of the first and
last volumes of a set, as it sometimes happens that
they are not the first or last issued. Often enough the
volumes of a set are made up of two or more editions with
long intervals between the dates. In all cases the earliest
and latest dates are to be given, and any peculiarities of the
edition can be stated in the form of a note at the end of
the entry.</p>

<p>Taking another book we find that the title-page reads:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson, by Richard Garnett,
LL.D. London, Walter Scott, &amp;c. 1888</p>

<p id="sec29"><b>29.</b>&mdash;The desirability, or otherwise, of using initials
instead of giving the Christian name in full in an author-entry
depends largely upon the requirements of the library
and the space taken up.</p>

<p>There seems to be a growing practice to search out
from any available source all the names that an author
was ever saddled with. The object of this for catalogues,
other than those of great libraries of national importance,
is not very obvious, and it should not concern the cataloguer
why Dickens chose to be known as Charles simply
instead of Charles John Huffam, or Du Maurier preferred
to be called George rather than George Louis Palmela
Busson, or even why Hall Caine has dropped the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Thomas Henry from the fore part of his name. Yet these
and other persons have appeared with all the names set
out at length even in minor catalogues, and sometimes
with the titles of the books cut down to the finest limit in
order that the whole name might be got in. The spirit of
infinite research is not always an advantage to the cataloguer.</p>

<p id="sec30"><b>30.</b>&mdash;On the other hand, bare initials have a meagre
appearance, and the middle course should be adopted even
when expense is a consideration, as it adds very little to
the cost of printing to give at least one name in full. It
must be admitted that in many instances where there are
two or more Christian names, the initials are distinctive
enough for all reasonable purposes, as E. A. Abbott,
A. K. H. Boyd, E. A. Freeman, and can be so used.
Well-understood abbreviations, like Chas. Dickens, Geo.
R. Sims, Robt. Browning, Thos. Carlyle, can also be
used, but the gain is so trifling as not to be worth consideration.
The first Christian name in use should be
given in full, unless it happens that some other is better
or specially known, as W. H. Davenport Adams, J. Percy
Groves, J. Cotter Morison, R. Bosworth Smith.</p>

<p id="sec31"><b>31.</b>&mdash;With the commoner surnames, as Smith, Brown,
Jones, and the rest, there will be a number of authors
who will have also the same Christian name, when particular
care must be exercised not to mix the works
together, and so attribute books to a wrong author. Some
distinction must be given, like that shown in the “Taylor
of Norwich” entry (p. 27), and these are better printed in
italics. Examples of these, taken from a catalogue, are</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Smith, John, <i>A. L. S.</i></p>

<p>Smith, John, <i>of Kilwinning</i>.</p>

<p>Smith, John, <i>of Malton</i>.</p>

<p>Thomson, James (<i>poet</i>, 1700-48).</p>

<p>Thomson, James (“B. V.”)</p>

<p>Thomson, James (<i>Traveller</i>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">When father and son with the same name are authors, and
the difference between them appears in the book as “the
elder,” “jun.,” “fils,” “aîné,” &amp;c., it should be given at the
time the entry is made, even though not then required
for distinguishing purposes, the library only possessing the
works of one or the other. Frequently such a distinction
is not shown on the book, and the cataloguer must add it.
Strange to say, entries like the following have been seen
in catalogues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Frères, P. Modes et costumes historiques.</p>

<p>Nassau, W., <i>sen.</i> Journals kept in France and
Italy.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The first book being by the Paquet frères, and the other
by Nassau W. Senior.</p>

<p id="sec32"><b>32.</b>&mdash;Biographical dictionaries of all kinds are useful to
the cataloguer, but for making distinctions like those
referred to above, and for general use, the most serviceable
and handiest, because concise and comprehensive, is
“The dictionary of biographical reference, containing one
hundred thousand names,” by Lawrence B. Phillips
(Sampson Low, 1871.) There is a later edition of this
work, but it is merely a reprint with no new matter. It
should be superfluous to name the valuable and indispensable
“Dictionary of national biography” for British
names. Allibone’s “Critical dictionary of English literature
and British and American authors,” with its supplement
by Kirk, is an every-day book of reference for
cataloguers. For German biography the “Allgemeine
deutsche Biographie” (Leipzig, 1875-98), is the most
important, and for French names the “Biographie universelle”
(Paris, 1842-65) is very serviceable, as well as
for names generally. It should be supplemented by
Vapereau’s “Dictionnaire des contemporains.”</p>

<p id="sec33"><b>33.</b>&mdash;The form for author-entry is clear and simple
enough, and seems easy to put into practice, but difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
soon arise, and the amount of knowledge the cataloguer
possesses upon men in general and authors in particular
will be early put to the test. The next book coming
before us is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Vice versâ; or, a lesson to fathers. By F. Anstey.
New and revised ed. London, Smith, Elder,
&amp;c., 1883.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The author’s name in this instance is a pseudonym, and
the mode of treating such names has given rise to differences
of opinion, and consequently of practice. In
many catalogues the real name of the author, when known,
is taken for the author-entry, and a reference given from
the pseudonym to it. This may be a good rule to follow
in very special catalogues, but there is no doubt that it is
against the convenience of the great majority of persons
who use libraries; and therefore the best, because most
convenient and useful, plan is to make the entry under the
<i>best known name</i>, whether it be assumed or real. It has
been often said, and with much truth, that it is not the
business of librarians to discover the identity of an author
by proving his use of an <i>alias</i> unless for some sufficient
reason. It has become quite a mania with some cataloguers
to hunt and pry until they find out whether a name
is real or not, and their zeal in this direction sometimes
misleads them, as witness the fact that “George Eliot”
has been entered as Mrs. Lewes in quite a number of
catalogues, and Marie Corelli is called Marion Mackay.
The cataloguer, besides putting himself to the bother of
being ever on the look-out for real names, gives readers
the trouble and vexation of looking in several places in
the catalogue before they can find the author’s works they
are in search of. People wanting books by “Ouida” do
not care to be told on turning to that name to “see De
la Ramé,” or “Ramée, L. de la,” or even “La Ramé.”
It would be equally absurd, on the other hand, to refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from Dickens to “Boz,” or Thackeray to “Titmarsh;”
therefore use the best known names. When the pseudonym
is the most familiar name, and the principal entry is
accordingly given under that form, then it is desirable, but
not absolutely essential, to also give the real name, when
known with certainty, enclosing it in parentheses, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Anstey, F. (T. Anstey Guthrie).</p>

<p>Hobbes, John Oliver (Mrs. P. M. T. Craigie).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes the pseudonym is printed in italics in all
entries, but this only serves to emphasise the name, without
indicating that it is a known pseudonym. If it is
wished to point out that the name is assumed, then the
customary form of printing it in inverted commas is better
understood, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Twain, Mark” (Samuel L. Clemens),</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but this need only be in the author-entry. Upon these
lines the book before us appears as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Anstey</span>, F.” (T. Anstey Guthrie).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Vice versâ; or, a lesson to fathers. New ed.
1883</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">To perfectly complete the author-entry and to prevent any
possibility of mistake, we require a cross-reference pointing
from the real name to the pseudonym under which the
entry is found, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Guthrie, T. Anstey. <i>See</i> Anstey, F.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If space is of no consideration, and it is wished to make
the entry as exact as possible, then the form is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Anstey, F. (<i>pseudonym of</i> T. Anstey Guthrie),</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and the reference reads</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Guthrie, T. Anstey. <i>See</i> Anstey F. (<i>pseud.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p id="sec34"><b>34.</b>&mdash;Before leaving this question of the treatment of
pseudonymous books attention may be directed to other
phases of it. There is the difficulty that occasionally arises
of an author publishing under a pseudonym and under his
real name and being equally as well-known under both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Instances of this would be the Rev. John M. Watson, whose
theological works appear under his own name, and his stories
under “Ian Maclaren;” and J. E. Muddock, who publishes
some stories under that name and, it is said, his detective
stories under the name of “Dick Donovan.” Common-sense
might offer the suggestion to adhere to the rule
already laid down and enter under both names, but this
violates one of the first principles of dictionary cataloguing,
viz., that all works by an author must be brought together
under a single name. Therefore in such cases there is no
option but to adopt the real name, at the same time taking
care to remove all occasion of difficulty by giving cross-references,
as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Maclaren, Ian.” <i>See</i> Watson, John M.</p>

<p>“Donovan, Dick.” <i>See</i> Muddock, J. E.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec35"><b>35.</b>&mdash;Then there are books that have a phrase for the
pseudonym, like “One who has kept a diary,” or “A
whistler at the plough.” These, while nominally pseudonyms,
are virtually anonyms, and it is customary in full
and special catalogues to make the entry under the first
word not an article of such a phrase-name. It may be
considered as very likely that such an entry in the majority
of catalogues would be quite superfluous. Books like:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Five years penal servitude, by One who has endured
it.”</p>

<p>“Three in Norway, by Two of them.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">would be better dealt with if the title-entries, such as
these, were taken as the principal entries and the
pseudonym ignored. This is a case where the cataloguer
will use his discretion as to the best course to pursue, being
guided by the requirements of the library, but it is a
mistake on the right side to give both forms if there is
the least doubt.</p>

<p id="sec36"><b>36.</b>&mdash;Books with initials only instead of the author’s name
come between the pseudonymous and anonymous. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
initials may be those of a name or indicate a title or
profession. In all cases where the name veiled by
the initials cannot be discovered, or their meaning
ascertained, then the entry is given under the <i>last</i> letter,
but if the letters stand for a known pseudonym, as
“A.L.O.E.,” or a title or degree, as “by an M.P.,” or
“M.A. (Oxon),” then the first letter is taken instead of the
last. Occasionally an initialism will be given like, “by
B.H.W., D.D.,” when, the meaning being clear, the entry
will be under the W., as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>W., B.H., <i>D.D.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If it is known what the name is that is covered by the
initials, as A.K.H.B., or L.E.L., then the entry is given
under the name in full,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Boyd, A.H.K.</p>

<p>Landon, L.E.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but it is requisite that cross-references be given from the
initialism, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>B., A.K.H. <i>See</i> Boyd, A.K.H.</p>

<p>L., L.E. <i>See</i> Landon, L.E.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The remark as to whether it is worth while in minor
catalogues to give an entry under a phrase-pseudonym
applies equally to the initials, and is open to the same
doubts.</p>

<p id="sec37"><b>37.</b>&mdash;In arranging the entries in alphabetical order it
should be noted that initials take precedence of all other
names in each particular letter, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>B., A.K.H.</p>

<p>B., G.W.</p>

<p>Baar, Thomas.</p>

<p>“Bab.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The works most useful to the cataloguer in revealing real
names are Halkett and Laing’s <i>Dictionary of the anonymous
and pseudonymous literature of Great Britain</i>, Cushing’s
<i>Initials and pseudonyms</i>, and <i>Les supercheries littéraires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dévoilées</i>, par Quérard. A list of pseudonyms, mostly
modern instances, with the real names, will be found in
<a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a>, by those who may require it.</p>

<p id="sec38"><b>38.</b>&mdash;The next illustration is selected because it is
distinctly anonymous, that is the author is not shown in
any form in the book, either by a pseudonym or initialism,
and the ordinary sources of information do not enable the
authorship to be discovered.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Times and days: being essays in romance and history,
pp. viii, 215. sm. 8o. 1889</p>

</div>

<p>Upon such books, if they are worth it, the industry of
the cataloguer may very well be exercised, as librarians and
the public feel that they are fully justified in finding out
who the author is if they can. If the book is of any
importance the name of the author is sure to be revealed
for general information sooner or later, and the possibility
of this adds zest to the search for the name at the moment
it is needed by the cataloguer. Besides the works of
reference mentioned already, Watt’s <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i>
should be consulted (for the older books), Barbier’s
<i>Dictionnaire des ouvrages anonymes</i>, and any special
bibliographies or catalogues within reach, not forgetting the
great <i>British Museum Catalogue of Printed Books</i>. Local
catalogues often prove valuable in this work, as the identity of
an author may be well-known locally but not further. It is
as well to point out that if a work is merely “ascribed,” or
“said to be” by a particular person it is better to regard
the book as altogether anonymous. To name a case in
point, Halkett and Laing ascribe the authorship of the, at
one time, celebrated “red pamphlets” on the <i>Mutiny of
the Bengal Army</i> to a Major Bunbury, whereas the author
is now known to have been the late Colonel G. B. Malleson.</p>

<p>In the event of the search after the author’s name proving
futile, the rule is that the principal entry be given
under the first word of the title <i>not an article</i>, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
way as the entries follow in the work of Halkett and Laing.
Should the library be a small one of a general character it
would be somewhat pedantic to adhere rigidly to this rule,
more especially if the subject of the book is clearly stated
upon its title-page. For example, books like, <i>A short
history of Poland</i>, and <i>The rambler’s guide to Harrogate</i>,
would be amply and satisfactorily dealt with if entries were
alone given under “Poland” and “Harrogate” respectively,
instead of under “Short” and “Rambler’s,” as required by
the rule.</p>

<p id="sec39"><b>39.</b>&mdash;When books are said to be “by the author of &mdash;”
and it cannot be ascertained who the author is, then they are
treated as altogether anonymous and dealt with accordingly,
as</p>

<p id="sec40"><b>40.</b>&mdash;There are further difficulties that arise from time to
time in making the author-entry owing to the great variety
in the form of authors’ names. The first book we take to
illustrate one of these is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>M. Tullii Ciceronis Orationes; with a commentary
by George Long. (Bibliotheca classica;
ed. by George Long and A. J. Macleane.) 4 v.
la. 8o. 1855-62</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The rule is to transcribe Greek and Latin names either
into the English form, as Cicero, Horace, Livy, Ovid, or
into the Latin nominative as M. Tullius Cicero, and therefore
the entry will be:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Greek names are not simply transcribed in Roman characters,
as Homeros, but into the English or Latin form, as
Homer, Homerus. All forms of the name, irrespective of
the language of the original book or its translations,
must be concentrated under the form adopted; thus the
following three books,</p>

<p class="noindent">It is very rarely required to give cross-references from the
one form of name to the other, especially in the case of
the classical authors. It should be noted that absolute
uniformity is necessary in the style of such names in a
single catalogue, be the form Latin or English, as it would
be inconsistent to have, say Virgilius in one place, and
Livy in another&mdash;in other words, it should be Virgil and
Livy or Livius and Virgilius, popular libraries adopting the
English form as most suitable.</p>

<p id="sec41"><b>41.</b>&mdash;The customary mode of arranging the entries in
such a case as the Horace given above, is to give first the
whole works in the original, then the whole works in
translations, afterwards the portions in the original followed
by translations of these in their turn, the greater parts
taking precedence of the lesser, and those in the language
of the original coming before translations without regard
to alphabetical order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec42"><b>42.</b>&mdash;There are classes of persons whose names come
oftener under the notice of the cataloguer for subject-than
for author-entry, such as sovereigns, princes, saints, and
popes; but as one rule governs both forms of entry, it may
be referred to at this point. All such personages are entered
under the Christian names by which they are known and
not under family or titular names. With these names are
included those of ancient or mediæval use before the days
of fixed surnames, or when they were merely sobriquets.
Omitting titles of books in illustration examples of all
these with the correct form would be:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Albert, <i>Prince Consort</i>.</p>

<p>Albert Edward, <i>Prince of Wales</i>.</p>

<p>Augustine, <i>St.</i></p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis.</p>

<p>Leo XIII., <i>Pope</i>.</p>

<p>Paul, <i>St.</i></p>

<p>Thomas a’Becket.</p>

<p>Thomas a’Kempis.</p>

<p>Victoria, <i>Queen</i>.</p>

<p>William <i>of Malmesbury</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It would be safer to provide cross-references for such
names as Thomas a’ Becket and Thomas a’ Kempis, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Becket, Thomas a’. <i>See</i> Thomas a’ Becket.</p>

<p>Kempis, Thomas a’. <i>See</i> Thomas a’ Kempis.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec43"><b>43.</b>&mdash;Strange to say, it is quite a common mistake in
catalogues to enter all the saints together under “Saint,”
instead of under their names, and it has even been attempted
to justify such an obvious absurdity by the contention that
people naturally turn to the word “Saint” for such
names. This is very likely, but it would be just as
reasonable to expect to find Lord Beaconsfield’s books
under “Lord” or “Earl,” and Mr. Gladstone’s under
“Mr.” Besides, if such a rule were logically carried out
in the case of every person canonized, Sir Thomas More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
would now be entered under “Blessed,” and Thomas a’
Becket under “Saint.”</p>

<p id="sec44"><b>44.</b>&mdash;In the case of noblemen who are authors,
the entry should be under the title, and not under the
family name, though it may be necessary in some instances
to give a cross-reference from the family name. Illustrative
examples of these would be:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Beaconsfield, Earl of. Coningsby.</p>

<p>Disraeli, Benjamin. <i>See</i> Beaconsfield.</p>

<p>Argyll, Duke of. The reign of law.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In full catalogues it is usual to give more particulars, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Beaconsfield, Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of.</p>

<p>Argyll, George D. Campbell, 8th Duke of.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but even in concise catalogues, if the library happens to
possess books by noblemen of the same title, the distinction
must be clearly shown as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Albemarle, 6th Earl of. Fifty years of my life.</p>

<p>Albemarle, 8th Earl of. Cycling.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">or fuller still, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Derby, Edward, 14th Earl of. The Iliad of
Homer, translated.</p>

<p>Derby, Edward H., 15th Earl of. Speeches and
addresses.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec45"><b>45.</b>&mdash;In some exceptional and well-defined cases, it is
better to place the entries under the family name, for the
reason that it is more in common use and so is better known,
as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bacon, Francis, Lord Verulam.</p>

<p>Walpole, Horace, Earl of Orford.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is important to remember that the title of the author to
be used is not that of the time when the book happened to
be published, but the highest attained to at the time the
catalogue is prepared or issued.</p>

<p id="sec46"><b>46.</b>&mdash;This brings us to the question as to the extent in
which titles of honour, of professional rank, or of scholastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
attainment are to be used in cataloguing, particularly in
connection with authors’ names. This is a matter that has
been settled more by convenience and usage than by fixed
rules. It is usual to omit all titles of rank below that of a
knight, all such distinctions to a name as “Baronet,”
“Knight,” “Right Honourable,” and “Honourable,” as
well as the initials of the various orders of knighthood, as
K.G., K.C.B., C.B., &amp;c. University degrees and initials
of membership of learned or other societies, as D.D.,
M.A., F.R.S., F.R.Hist.S., &amp;c., are ignored, and so
are professional titles, as Professor, Colonel, Doctor,
Barrister-at-Law. For example, in the “republic of letters,”
as exemplified in cataloguing,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Right Honourable Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke,
Bart., M.P.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">becomes simply</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dilke, Sir Charles W.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Right Honourable Professor F. Max Müller.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Müller, F. Max.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Upon the same plan most of the ecclesiastical titles are
passed over, or at anyrate all under the rank of a dean, and
all the prefixes as “Right Reverend,” “Rev.” are left out.
Thus</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of London,
Mandell Creighton, D.D., &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is reduced to</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Creighton, Mandell, <i>Bp. of London</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">or shorter still, if desired, to</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Creighton, Mandell, <i>Bp.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It has been found that simple treatment of this kind meets
every requirement, and it is quite unnecessary to waste
space in a catalogue by adding superfluous matter of this
kind, besides the line must be drawn somewhere, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the cataloguer has no reason, even for politic motives, to
indulge in snobbery, there is no occasion to swell a
catalogue to undue proportions.</p>

<p id="sec47"><b>47.</b>&mdash;If it is desired, however, to include degrees or
other distinctive affixes, they must follow the Christian
name, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Jones, Thomas, <i>LL.D.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and not</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Jones, <i>LL.D.</i>, Thomas.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Prefixes would be inserted in their proper order, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Jones, <i>Dr.</i> Thomas.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Anything not actually part of the author’s name should be
made distinctive by being printed in italics as here shown.</p>

<p id="sec48"><b>48.</b>&mdash;It cannot be too often impressed on the young
cataloguer how important it is to keep himself well posted
in all changes occurring in the world around, and, more
particularly, in the literary and social world. While many
sources of information are available in a well-equipped
library, yet none of these can compensate for a retentive
memory and a mind keenly alive even for the comparatively
trivial affairs that need to be constantly noted if error is to
be avoided, or at least if the catalogue is to show the latest
information. For instance, as each New Year and Queen’s
Birthday comes round the lists of new honours gazetted have
to be read, as an author or two may be among those raised
to the peerage or be made baronets or knights and their
style in the catalogue has to be altered accordingly. This
may be considered unnecessary advice because catalogues
of libraries are supposed to, and do, cover the whole field
of human knowledge in all directions, and it is part of the
cataloguer’s business to keep his knowledge modernized if
his services are to be worth much. It is as well, however,
to point this out to beginners, otherwise, if attention be not
paid to such details, they will very soon find, or others will
for them, that they have books written by the same person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
under two names, sometimes three, in a single catalogue.
Many examples could be given of how this can be brought
about, but it will suffice to give one. The first edition,
1887, of the book on cycling in the “Badminton Library”
series has the names of Viscount Bury and G. L. Hillier as
the authors, and the new edition of 1895 is by the Earl of
Albemarle and G. L. Hillier. It would not do for a library
possessing the first edition only to now enter it under
“Bury,” nor for a library with both editions to enter one
under “Bury” and the other under “Albemarle.”</p>

<p id="sec49"><b>49.</b>&mdash;This point may be further emphasized by stating
that ecclesiastical changes in the higher orders of the clergy
have to be carefully observed from time to time, so that the
very latest office is shown at the time the catalogue is
printed, or that the alteration is made if in manuscript. It
would not look well to continue to describe Frederick
Temple as Bishop of Exeter or even as Bishop of London,
Mandell Creighton as Bishop of Peterborough, or Frederick
W. Farrar as Archdeacon, though their names may so appear
upon the books being catalogued.</p>

<p>Occasionally books will be found by authors whose
ecclesiastical office and not their names appear upon the
title-pages, as “by William, Bishop of Chester,” “by the
Archbishop of York,” when the name must be sought out
and care taken to give the credit of the book to the right
person. For instance, there is a book upon the Riviera,
published in 1870, “by the Dean of Canterbury,” which
might easily be credited to Dean Payne Smith instead of
Dean Alford, and a very careless or unthinking cataloguer
might even add it to Dean Farrar’s books. In this connection
a very useful book of reference is <i>The book of dignities</i>,
by Joseph Haydn, continued by Horace Ockerby, 1894,
and of course any back volumes available of clerical
directories or diocesan calendars will prove useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec50"><b>50.</b>&mdash;But the ladies have to be watched with much greater
care, as they are so much more apt to change their name,
and that without any evidence of such change being given
upon the title-page. Many examples might be given of
ladies who have written under both their maiden and
their married names. If the ladies continue writing under
their maiden names, then the rule given for pseudonymous
books would fitly apply, and the more familiar name should
be used, as M. E. Braddon, and not Mrs. Maxwell,
Florence Warden, and not Mrs. James. Where women
authors are better known under their husbands’ names
with the prefix “Mrs.,” as Mrs. Humphry Ward, Mrs.
Coulson Kernahan, &amp;c., it will be found that the best
known form is also the best for use in a general or popular
catalogue, though it would be more exact to give the
ladies’ own names. If exactness is of prime importance,
then the distinction can very well be shown, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ward, Mary A. (Mrs. Humphry Ward).</p>

<p>Kernahan, Jeanie G. (Mrs. Coulson Kernahan).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">When both the maiden and married names are given upon
a title-page, as “Katharine Tynan (Mrs. H. A. Hinkson),”
then it is better to adopt the married name for the entry,
but a cross-reference should be given, especially if books
have been issued under the maiden name alone. Accordingly
the entry would be</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hinkson, Katharine (Katharine Tynan).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and the reference</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Tynan, Katharine. <i>See</i> Hinkson, Katharine.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec51"><b>51.</b>&mdash;Peculiarities of form in surnames will next demand
consideration, and probably the first of these will be
names with patronymic or other prefixes. If the author is
English, or has virtually become so (and “English” is to
be here understood in its widest sense), then the prefix is
simply regarded as a part of the name, and as such it will lead
off. The following are some examples of names in this form:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>St. John, Percy B.</p>

<p>De Crespigny, E. C.</p>

<p>D’Israeli, Isaac</p>

<p>Fitz George, George</p>

<p>Le Gallienne, Richard.</p>

<p>L’Estrange, A. G.</p>

<p>M’Crie, Thomas.</p>

<p>MacDonald, George.</p>

<p>O’Brien, William.</p>

<p>Ap John, Lewis.</p>

<p>Van Dyck, Sir A.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec52"><b>52.</b>&mdash;In French names the entry should not be made
under the prefix “de,” but under the name next following
it, unless the “de” has become so much embodied in
the surname as to be an integral part of it rather than a
prefix. If the prefix happens to be the definite article
“le” or “la,” or the article is comprised in it, as “du,”
then the entry is to be given under the prefix. The
following names show the part of the name which leads
off:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Maupas, C. E. de.</p>

<p>Decourcelle, A.</p>

<p>Delaroche, Paul.</p>

<p>La Bruyère, Jean de.</p>

<p>La Sizeranne, Robert de.</p>

<p>Le Monnier, L.</p>

<p>Du Boisgobey, F.</p>

<p>Du Camp, Maximè.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In arranging such names for alphabetical order they are
placed as if the prefix were part of the name, and the last
five would come in place as Labr., Lasi., Lemo., Dubo., Duca.
The English names are treated in much the same manner,
but contractions are to be placed as if spelt out in full,
and letters omitted by elision are to be ignored. In this
way the English names given above would come in order:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
St. John as Saint John (not as Saintj, however, but <i>before</i>
Sainte, as Sainte-Beuve), De Crespigny as Decre., D’Israeli
as Disra., Le Gallienne as Legall., L’Estrange as Lestr.,
M’Crie as Maccrie, Mac Donald as Macdon., O’Brien as
Obri., Ap John as Apjohn, and Van Dyck as Vandyck.
Of course, the names must in no wise be altered from the
form appearing upon the title-pages even for the purpose
of harmonising them with neighbouring names in the
alphabetical sequence.</p>

<p id="sec53"><b>53.</b>&mdash;In German and Dutch names the “von” and
“van” are entered after the name similarly to the French
“de” as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ewald, G. H. A. von.</p>

<p>Beneden, P. J. van.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Some cataloguers keep these and the French “de” in
their place as prefixes, at the same time ignoring them for
alphabetical order, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">von Ewald, G. H. A.</p>

<p class="noindent">van Beneden, P. J.</p>

<p class="noindent">de Cuvier, Georges, Baron.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">of course, placing them under Ewald, Beneden, Cuvier. The
effect is not wholly satisfactory and it breaks the running
line in the alphabet.</p>

<p id="sec54"><b>54.</b>&mdash;The next difficulty is that of the compound names.
It has been already hinted that stereotyped uniformity is
not always to be recommended, but in dealing with names
of this type it is as well to fix a rule and adhere rigidly to
it. In the case of English compound names the best
course to adopt is to give the entries under the <i>last</i> name
in all cases. Examples of such names would be</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Phillipps, J. O. Halliwell.</p>

<p>Turner, C. Tennyson.</p>

<p>Dunton, Theodore Watts.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">These are so well known to most people as changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
names, that it would not be quite correct to give merely
an initial for the first name, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Phillipps, J. O. H.</p>

<p>Turner, C. T.</p>

<p>Dunton, Theodore W.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">though in most cases of compound names, this would not
signify.</p>

<p>Under some rules for cataloguing, it is recommended
that where the author has added to his name at a late
period of his life, as the above-named persons have, then
the entry should be given under the first part of the
name. The objection to adopting this course is that two
methods would be in use, and they would likely lead
to confusion, for the reason that it is not always clearly or
generally known that a compound name consists in reality of
the addition of a name to the original surname. It is more
frequently the case, owing to fashion or foible, that two
names already belonging by right to a person have simply
been joined by a hyphen, and so become “compounded.”
Again, it is not always shown or known that a new name
has been taken, as for instance J. F. B. Firth so described
himself upon his books on London Government, and not
as J. F. Bottomley-Firth, though he was born Bottomley,
and took the name of Firth afterwards. Therefore, all
things considered, it is wiser to adhere to the last name,
more especially as it is so easy to safeguard it in doubtful
cases by the useful cross-reference, such as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Tennyson-Turner, C. <i>See</i> Turner.</p>

<p>Halliwell-Phillipps, J. O. <i>See</i> Phillipps.</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton, Theodore. <i>See</i> Dunton.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Even these cross-references are seldom necessary, as it may
reasonably be presumed that if a person fails to find the
entries under the one name he turns to the other, thus if
he wants books by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, and fails to
find them under Baring, it is unlikely that he will conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
they are not in the library without first looking under
Gould.</p>

<p id="sec55"><b>55.</b>&mdash;But while this rule for making use of the last part
of a compound name holds good for English authors, the
reverse method must be adopted as correct for foreign
compound names, and the entry given accordingly under
the first part of such a name, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dreux-Brézé, Marquis de.</p>

<p>Martinengo-Cesaresco, Countess.</p>

<p>Merle d’Aubigné, J. H.</p>

<p>Tascher de la Pagerie, Comtesse de.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It will be seen that this form is principally governed by
the custom of the country to which the author happens to
belong, and cataloguers will make themselves acquainted
with the usages of each country as far as they can, either
by reading or by constant reference to native biographical
dictionaries and authoritative catalogues.</p>

<p id="sec56"><b>56.</b>&mdash;In an average British library oriental names will
only occasionally come under the notice of the cataloguer,
and then for the most part attached to English books. A
general rule may be laid down that the first part of such
names should be taken for the author-entry, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Omar Khayyam. Rubàiyàt; transl. by Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Wo Chang. England through Chinese spectacles.</p>

<p>Dosabhai Framji Karaka. History of the Parsis.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but a rule of this kind must not be blindly followed, as it
is sure to have exceptions. Some other part of the name
may be the best known or even correct form, as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ranjitsinhji, K. S. The Jubilee book of cricket.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">remembering always that the surname according to Western
ideas, handed on from one generation to another does not
exist in the East. In every case it is a wise plan to consult
any available catalogues that have been compiled by
experts in oriental language and custom. Care is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
necessary in dealing with these names lest it should be
found when too late that the entry has been given under a
title and not a name. On pages 76-97 of Linderfelt’s
<i>Eclectic card catalog rules</i> will be found a list of oriental
titles and occupations with their signification, and the use
of this will do much to prevent mistakes of the kind. Beale’s
<i>Oriental biographical dictionary</i>; revised by H. G. Keene
(W. H. Allen, 1894) is also a helpful work in this
connection.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PRINCIPAL ENTRY.&mdash;THE AUTHOR-ENTRY, 4.</span></h2>

<p id="sec57"><b>57.</b>&mdash;When books are written in collaboration, the customary
procedure is to make the entry under the first-named
author, if not more than two are given on the
title-page, followed by the name of the second. If there
are more than two authors, then the name of the
first only is given, followed by “and others,” or “&amp;c.,” as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Woods, Robert A., and others. The poor in
great cities.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is desirable to give a cross-reference from every joint-author
to the name under which the entry is placed, but it
depends greatly upon the style of the catalogue whether
this is done or not. In most cases it will be found that
the references can be dispensed with if more than two
authors, and often enough from the second when but two.
It is unlikely, for example, that a reference is necessary
from Rice to Besant for the novels by Besant and Rice,
or from Chatrian for those by Erckmann-Chatrian. If,
however, the second-named author is also the single author
of other books in the library, the reference is unavoidable
and must be given. In the principal entry it is unnecessary
to reverse the names of any author but the first,
though this is sometimes done, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Besant, Sir Walter, and Rice, James;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but the better form is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Besant, Sir Walter, and James Rice.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec58"><b>58.</b>&mdash;The order of arrangement for books written by an
author who is also a joint-author is to give first those
books written by him alone; then those books in which he
has collaborated, with his name occupying the leading
place upon the title-page; and lastly the references to
other authors with whom he has joined, but with his name
in a secondary place. The entries would be separately
alphabetical in each of these divisions. The following
illustrates this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>, Robert L. The black arrow.</p>

<p>⸻ Weir of Hermiston.</p>

<p>⸻ and Fanny. The dynamiter.</p>

<p>⸻ and Lloyd <span class="smcap">Osbourne</span>. The ebb-tide.</p>

<p>⸻ The wrecker.</p>

<p>⸻ <i>See also</i> Henley, W. E.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec59"><b>59.</b>&mdash;As in this illustration the repeat dash has been
used, it may be here stated that its purpose is to
save the repetition of the author’s name in each entry
after the first, and, as shown in the case of “The wrecker,”
it is unnecessary to give more than a single dash in any
instance, as the position of the entry denotes that it is by
the same authors as the preceding book. It was owing
to the misuse of this dash that the old catalogue joke
arose of</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mill, J. S. On liberty.</p>

<p>⸻ On the Floss.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and others equally ridiculous are to be found in catalogues
where the dash is not limited in use as a repeat for
authors’ names, or as a repeat to a subject-heading, but
this point is further dealt with under subject-cataloguing
(Section 102). It must be noted that in the case of authors’
or editors’ names the dash is strictly limited in use as a
repeat for second and further books by the same author,
and not to repeat all authors with the same surname, as</p>

<p id="sec60"><b>60.</b>&mdash;Music is not usually treated upon the supposition
that the librettist is joint-author with the composer. The
latter is always regarded as the author and the entry given
under his name only. The reason for this is that in the
case of operas, oratorios, and the like the libretto is a mere
secondary matter and the books are placed in libraries for
the music only, and in the vocal scores of operas there is
seldom a complete libretto. In this way the Gilbert-Sullivan
operas are entered only under Sullivan, and if thought
desirable a reference may be given from Gilbert, but it is
not essential. The following is from the title-page of one
of these operas.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“An entirely new and æsthetic opera in two acts
entitled ‘Patience; or, Bunthorne’s bride,’ written
by W. S. Gilbert, composed by Arthur Sullivan,
arranged from the full score by Berthold Tours.
London.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Properly adapted this would appear in the catalogue as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Sullivan</span>, Sir Arthur S.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Patience; or, Bunthorne’s bride: opera;
arranged by Berthold Tours. (<i>Vocal score.</i>)
pp. 117. 4o. n.d.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is hardly necessary to say that if on the other hand the
libretto only of an opera or similar work were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
library, the entry would be given under the librettist, and
the composer would be ignored, as there would be none of
his work in the book.</p>

<p>Occasionally an exception to these rules will arise, and
would be found in a book like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Moore’s Irish melodies; with accompaniments
by M. W. Balfe.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">because it is likely enough that an edition of Moore’s
Melodies with music would be called for without regard to
the composer, though the book may have been placed in
the library more on account of the music. Therefore, both
entries must be given, that under the arranger’s name
being the principal, as</p>

<p id="sec61"><b>61.</b>&mdash;When a book consists of a collection of essays or
articles by a number of authors, gathered together by an
editor, it is proper to give the principal entry under the
editor’s name rather than under that of the first-named
author in the contents. If a book of this nature is of
sufficient importance, each of its divisions can be treated
as a separate work, and author-entries given, each author
being credited with his share only. As to how far books
of the kind are to be so dealt with must rest entirely with
the cataloguer, space and utility being the two important
points for his consideration. It frequently happens that a
single essay or section of a book contains the essence of
many volumes, and to a busy man such essays may be of
more real value than a whole book. Again, if a person is
interested in the work of a particular author, he will be glad
not only to have the complete books, but also his contributions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to miscellaneous works as well, and these are shown
by indexing the contents. To do this will add to the
extent and cost of a catalogue, but it will, at the same time,
add to its value and usefulness. Of course there are many
volumes of this miscellaneous nature, the contents of which
are of a very slight or ephemeral value, and to so index
them would be a waste of energy and of space. It is quite
as easy to overdo this indexing of contents as to carry it
out judiciously, as witness the fact that some librarians
have gone to the trouble of indexing the principal contents
of such obvious works of reference as the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, and the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.
In this matter, then, it will be seen that no fixed rule can
be laid down. Sometimes the setting out of the contents
under the principal entry will be sufficient. This does
not imply that the contents of volumes of magazines,
reviews, and the like should be so treated, as is sometimes
seen attempted, of course with sorry results so far as
completeness is concerned, because at best but a selection
can be given, and even this necessitates wading through
pages of closely-set small type; in fact, the only real
purpose it serves is to show what serial stories are in a
particular volume. No one can gainsay the fact that an
enormous quantity of valuable material lies hidden away in
back volumes of magazines, but librarians must depend upon
such works as Poole’s <i>Index to Periodical Literature</i>, with
its supplements, and the <i>Review of Reviews’ Annual Index
to Periodicals</i> to reveal it.</p>

<p id="sec62"><b>62.</b>&mdash;In some libraries the contents of miscellaneous
books are set out as well as indexed, but it is doubtful if it
is worth while doing both in the majority of cases. The
following entries show a well-known book fully treated in
this way so far as the principal and author entries only are
concerned:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">It is true that any person with the least knowledge of
English literature would know better than that these
authors had collaborated, but the cataloguer has to put
himself in the position of the man who knows nothing of
the matter. Cross-references from one author’s name to
the other in such a case would be absurd.</p>

<p id="sec65"><b>65.</b>&mdash;Anthologies or other compilations are to be entered

and not “<i>See</i>.” The best form for writing a cross-reference
is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec67"><b>67.</b>&mdash;It occasionally happens that both the work of the
artist and of the writer of the text are of sufficient importance
to warrant separate entries, but only one of the entries
should be the principal entry giving the fullest particulars.
A book of this kind is Ruskin’s edition of Turner’s
<i>Harbours of England</i>. As this particular edition is
published as one of Ruskin’s works, and Turner is more
subject than author, then the main entry is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Ruskin</span>, John.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The harbours of England; with … illustrations

</div>

</div>

<p id="sec68"><b>68.</b>&mdash;When a word not on the title-page is added to an
entry by the cataloguer, it is customary to show this by
enclosing it in brackets [&nbsp;] as the word “text” in the
above example. On the other hand, if words have been
left out from the transcript of the title-page as unnecessary
the omission is denoted by three points … as shown in the
Ruskin entry where the word “thirteen” has been passed
over. In the smaller libraries it will be found that it is
unnecessary to denote either additions or omissions in this
way, but where perfect exactness is of importance this is
the understood form for the purpose.</p>

<p>This Ruskin entry also shows that if it is already stated
in the title that the book is illustrated there is no occasion
to repeat “illus.” in the collation. There are many books
of which the value lies more in the illustrations than in the
text, such as those illustrated by Blake, Bewick, Cruikshank,
“Phiz,” and others. It is often found sufficient in such
cases to give a cross-reference from the artist to the author
illustrated, like</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Cruikshank</span>, George, Works illustrated by. <i>See</i>
Ainsworth, W. H.; Maxwell, W. H.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">it being, of course, understood that it is stated in the author-entry
that the particular edition is illustrated by the artist
from whose name the reference is given, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>, W. H.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">History of the Irish Rebellion, 1798; illus. by
Geo. Cruikshank.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">otherwise the reference would be worthless.</p>

<p>The extent to which these references are given depends
altogether upon the editions, as the cheap modern reprints
of books like Ainsworth’s novels do not call for notice of
the illustrations, and there are not many illustrators of
books&mdash;especially in these days of “process” reproduction&mdash;whose
work calls for the special attention of the
cataloguer.</p>

<p>In making references like the foregoing, or of any kind,
care should be exercised to give all the names necessary,
and not, as is sometimes done, but two or three, and then
finishing with a comprehensive “&amp;c.” which is less than no
use, inasmuch as it only serves to show that there are other
books in the library illustrated by this particular artist, but
what they are the cataloguer has neglected to state and
the inquirer is thus left in vexatious doubt.</p>

<p id="sec69"><b>69.</b>&mdash;In cataloguing the transactions, memoirs, proceedings
and other publications of the learned societies, the
societies in their corporate capacity are regarded as the

they are societies of a national or general character, as</p>

<p>Linnean Society.</p>

<p>Royal Geographical Society.</p>

<p>Society of Antiquaries.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Societies of a strictly local character are to be entered
under the name of the place of meeting or publication, as
for example the publications of the Literary and Philosophical
Society of Newcastle-on-Tyne are not entered
under “Literary,” but</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Newcastle-on-Tyne Literary and Philosophical Society,</p>

<p class="noindent">such an entry of course being kept quite apart from the

<p>There are antiquarian and other societies whose work
covers a much larger area than the particular locality in
which they hold meetings or their offices happen to be
situated, and they could not be fitly entered under the
name of the place. For instance, the publications of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire emanate from
Liverpool, but the place of meeting or publication might
be changed to Manchester or Chester without in any way
affecting the nature or scope of the Society’s work. Therefore
the entry in such a case should not be under Liverpool
or even “Historic,” but</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lancashire and Cheshire, Historic Society of.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Almost similar are the publishing societies dealing with a
limited area, as the Chetham and Surtees Societies, but the
specially distinctive name settles the matter, and the entries
would accordingly be under those names. Societies of this
class, however, are simply the publishers of collections of
books, and so, in addition to the entries under the societies’
names, each book must have a separate author-entry. The
entries would be after this manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">It would be within the scope of most catalogues to
separately enter under authors and subjects any exceptionally
important monographs published with or supplementary
to, the transactions of scientific or other societies, but to
go further than this and to catalogue in this way each
separate contribution to such transactions opens up so vast
a field of work that it need not be attempted. Special
libraries used only by special classes of the community
will have to settle the length to which they can go in this
direction according to their several requirements and the
means at their disposal. Something towards this end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
making available the contents of transactions, proceedings,
and the like has been accomplished in the <i>Royal Society’s
Catalogue of Scientific Papers</i>, but there is infinitely more
yet to be done and the majority of libraries will choose to
wait for the promised great <i>International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature</i> rather than attempt to index the
contents of whatever transactions they happen to possess
in their libraries, though this great catalogue has up to the
present got no further than the conference-and-dinner stage
of compilation.</p>

<p>The publications of foreign societies are usually entered
under the names of the countries if of national importance,
or places where they meet if of local importance,
unless they have a specially distinctive title. Government
publications are entered under the names of the countries
or places, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>France. Chambre des Députés.</p>

<p>Paris. Prefecture de la Seine.</p>

<p>United States Bureau of Education.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The publications of the home government cannot be
grouped under one head or title in this way, and must be
distributed under the names of the various departments as
Board of Trade, Local Government Board, Historical
Manuscripts Commission, Charity Commission, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The reports of Church Councils and official publications
of religious denominations occasionally call for some
consideration. Important ecclesiastical councils as the
Council of Trent or the Westminster Assembly of Divines
are entered under the names of the places of meeting, but
in the case of denominational assemblies where the place of
meeting is a mere incident, the entry is to be made under
the name of the denomination, and not the place of meeting.
Examples of such publications are</p>

<p id="sec70"><b>70.</b>&mdash;There is still one form of principal entry to be
considered, and that is when there is no author, editor, or
compiler whose name can be used and a title-entry becomes
a principal entry. The commonest form is that of
newspapers, magazines, and periodicals. These are invariably
entered under the first word of the title not an
article, and never under the editor’s name. The first and
last volumes of the series contained in the library with the
earliest and latest dates (<i>i.e.</i> years) are given, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Chambers’s Journal, v. 1-20. la. 8o. 1854-64</p>

<p>Strand Magazine. Illus. v. 1-14. la. 8o. 1891-7</p>

<p>Times, The. 47 v. la. fo. 1881-91</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If the series is incomplete then the volumes wanting must
be shown by the entry, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal. New ser., v. 9-15,
17, 19-20. la. 8o. 1848-54</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">this showing that volumes 1 to 8, 16, and 18 are not in
the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec71"><b>71.</b>&mdash;Another form of principal title-entry is that for the
sacred books, especially for the Bible in its various editions
and translations. It is customary to enter all editions in
all languages of the complete scriptures, or of portions of
them, under the word “Bible,” arranging the entries in this
order in the first place&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1 Old and New Testament (whether inclusive of the
Apocrypha or not).</p>

<p>2 Old Testament only.</p>

<p>3 Parts of Old Testament.</p>

<p>4 New Testament.</p>

<p>5 Parts of New Testament.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Each of these divisions are then arranged according to
language, and each of the languages again chronologically
according to the edition. When a library contains a fair
collection of versions and editions of the scriptures it is as
well to keep to the rule to place those first which are in the
original languages, but in the average English library it will
be found most convenient to lead off with the English
versions, followed by those in the original texts, and afterwards
with those in modern languages other than English.
The entries would be after the following style, but with
such distinctive bibliographical particulars as may be
desirable according to the importance and interest of the
collection.</p>

text, and then only if the edition is simply a version or
translation and is not accompanied by a commentary.
Commentaries are treated as any other original work would
be and entered under the author’s name, unless they
happened to be of a collective character, as <i>The Cambridge
Bible for schools and colleges</i>; ed. by Perowne, when the
principal-entry would be under “Bible” (<i>Subject</i> sub-division
“Commentaries”) preferably to “Cambridge Bible,” with
the contents of each volume of the series set out, not
alphabetically, but in the order of the books of the Bible, as</p>

<p id="sec72"><b>72.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the commentaries in a series are of
sufficient importance, or of such a character, that each is
virtually a book quite apart from its place as one of the

W. Robertson Nicoll, are of this class, and, while they
should in the first place be dealt with as shown in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<i>Cambridge Bible</i> above, yet a mere reference under the
author’s names hardly suffices&mdash;they are not merely editors
as in the <i>Cambridge Bible</i> series&mdash;therefore, besides this
principal-entry under Bible, entries are required, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Daniel. 1895</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Though coming more correctly under the remarks on
subject-headings it may be here noted in passing that
commentaries in a series are regarded as a single book and
not entered separately under the name of each book of
the Bible throughout the catalogue, therefore the above
items would not have entries under “Kings” or “Daniel.”
If, however, Dean Farrar had written a separate work dealing
with the Book of Daniel, it should be entered under “Daniel,”
and not under “Bible.” So commentaries, or any other
works upon the whole Bible, like the entire series of the
Expositor’s Bible, go under “Bible,” but if the commentaries
deal with the Old or New Testament, or any
particular book of the Bible separately, such works are
placed under the headings of “Old Testament,” “New
Testament,” or under the name of the particular book dealt
with, as the case may be, and not under the heading
“Bible,” as in the case of the text alone, or any portion of
it. There are exceptions even to this rule with regard to
translations, if special, and more particularly if accompanied
by an exposition, as in a case like</p>

</div>

<p id="sec73"><b>73.</b>&mdash;The extent to which editors and translators are to
be noticed in cataloguing is a very important one, but it
also depends largely upon the requirements of the case.
It should be taken for granted in large reference libraries
intended principally for use by scholars that every name
appearing upon a title-page, whether as author, editor,
translator, compiler, or adapter, would be noticed and
receive an entry, either in full or by way of cross-reference.
But for an average library, and particularly lending libraries,
it would be waste of energy and of space to adopt this
system and fully carry it out. Thus, a work like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Easy selections adapted from Xenophon; with
a vocabulary, notes, and a map, by J. Surtees
Phillpotts and C. S. Jerram.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">would in the former case have references from Phillpotts
and Jerram to Xenophon, under which the principal entry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
should appear. But in most cases a single entry will be
found ample, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Xenophon.</span> Easy selections; adapted, &amp;c. by
Phillpotts and Jerram.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, there are famous translations or
editions that should have in every case entries under the
translator’s or editor’s name, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Chapman, George. Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.</p>

<p>Jowett, Benjamin. The Republic of Plato.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">These are instances where two principal entries might be
given with advantage, firstly under “Homer” and “Plato,”
and secondly under “Chapman” and “Jowett,” as above.</p>

<p>Almost in the same category come those books which
have been revised and enlarged by an editor to such an
extent as to leave but little of the original author’s work.
Sometimes the revision and additions may not be so
extensive, but still be important enough to command a
separate entry under the reviser’s name. Examples of
these are</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Prescott</span>, Wm. H. History of the reign of the
Emperor Charles V., by Wm. Robertson, extended
by W. H. P.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tilden</span>, Wm. A. Watts’ Manual of chemistry.
v. 2, Organic chemistry. 2nd ed. 1886</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">these entries being in addition to those under “Robertson”
and “Watts.”</p>

<p id="sec74"><b>74.</b>&mdash;It occasionally occurs that a prefatory essay or
biographical or critical introduction to a book is of so
much value as to be worth a separate entry, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Courthorpe</span>, Wm. J. Life of Alexander Pope.
(Pope’s Works, v. 5.) 1889</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The careful cataloguer will rarely overlook these important
points, though it too often happens that sets of books are
lumped into a catalogue without the least attention to
details of this kind, leaving it incomplete and so making
the library less useful.</p>

<p id="sec75"><b>75.</b>&mdash;The form of author-entry, or its equivalent, having
been settled, the subject-entry now commands attention.
The importance of the author-entry is recognised, but it is
well known to librarians that, leaving fiction out of the
question, most inquiries are made in libraries for books
upon a particular subject, or for a special class of literature,
rather than for the works of a particular writer, the people
who know many authors not being so numerous as might
be supposed. Therefore it is essential in all cataloguing
work that the utmost attention be paid to the subjects.
Every volume dealt with should be thoroughly examined
for the purpose of ascertaining generally the nature of its
contents, and definitely the subject or subjects of which it
treats. This course should be pursued in every case, even
if the subject is so clearly defined upon the title-page that
to go beyond the statement there made would seem to be
a sheer waste of time, otherwise the “pitfalls” that lie in
the cataloguer’s way cannot be avoided. Besides, there
may be some particularly valuable feature of the book
hidden away in an appendix, or even a separate book
bound up in the same cover, which the first title-page will
not reveal.</p>

<p id="sec76"><b>76.</b>&mdash;When the subject of the book has been clearly
ascertained, an entry taken from the book itself or from
the principal entry already written, is made under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
name of the direct and definite <i>subject</i> of the book, not
under the class of literature to which it belongs or even
the form in which it is written. It is of the first importance
that the cataloguer should definitely decide the
particular subject-name he will adopt in order to avoid the
somewhat common blemish in catalogues of synonymous
headings. Having so decided, it will prevent future
mistakes if a cross-reference is immediately written and
sorted into place with the first lot of slips alphabetized
when it at once serves as a pointer in the right direction by
preventing books upon a single subject being placed under
two headings. Thus if the book in hand is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Newth</span>, Samuel. A first book of natural philosophy.
pp. viii., 136, illus. sm. 8o. 1867</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and the cataloguer has decided in favour of the heading
“Physics,” he will at once write a cross-reference</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Natural philosophy. <i>See</i> Physics.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which when put in its alphabetical sequence will point out
if slips have been inadvertently written under “Natural
Philosophy” that the chosen heading is “Physics,” and
that the entries must be so altered and arranged. The
subject-entry in this instance would be</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Physics:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Newth, S. First book of natural philosophy.
1867</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It will be here noted that under the subject-heading the
author’s surname leads off as it directs to the principal
entry where the fullest particulars concerning the book are
to be found, and consequently it is most unusual to give
the collation, size, and other information in all sub-entries.
It is advisable, however, to give the date of publication in
every entry excepting in the case of works of fiction under
the circumstances referred to in paragraph 24.</p>

<p id="sec77"><b>77.</b>&mdash;The forms of subject entries in dictionary
catalogues can be much better shown by means of example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with explanations than by statement alone, and for this
reason a number of ordinary books, not selected for any
difficulty they present, are given. These have been fully
worked out in the dictionary system, and are accompanied
in each case by the principal entry, so that the complete
series of entries can be seen. The styles of types in
printing commonly made use of to mark distinctions are
also shown.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is an excellent rule to follow that a subject must have at
least two books upon it before it is entitled to a “heading,”
such as the second of the above entries has. In the event
of the library possessing but this one book upon the
subject by the time the “copy” has to be sent to the
printer, it would then be reduced to title form, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Colour measurement and mixture. Abney, W.

</div>

<p id="sec78"><b>78.</b>&mdash;The third entry is under the name of the series.
Where space is a consideration, and only brief entries can
be given, the cataloguer can omit either the name of the
series from the principal entry and retain the entries under
the title heading of the series, or he may reverse the process
and leave out this third entry, as he may deem most
expedient, but if possible both should be retained, as they
afford useful information&mdash;in the first entry showing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the book is one of a particular series, and thereby giving
some idea of its character and scope, indeed it would not
be amiss for the same reason to include it in the second
entry, and the third entry form furnishes a list of the books
of this particular series in the library.</p>

<p class="noindent">Besides the curtailment of information given in the principal
entry already shown, the Christian names of authors are
reduced to simple initials, and the names of translators and
editors are omitted in all sub-entries. It is important to
notice the difference between “<i>See</i>” and “<i>See also</i>” in
cross-references; the first would prevent any entries being
placed under the subject-heading where it is given, as
already stated, but the second is intended to guide to lesser
or closely-related divisions of the subject under which it
appears. There may be a number of these <i>see alsos</i> under
a single heading by the time the catalogue is ready for
printing, when they are to be embodied into one entry,
as in the following illustration, where nine are so amalgamated</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>See also</i> Algæ. Cryptogamia. Ferns. Flowers.

<p>Of course, references of any kind must never be made
in anticipation, but at the moment when the book to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they refer is being catalogued; otherwise a series of references
will be the result that lead nowhere, as would be the
case in the above example if the library had no books upon
Algæ or the other subjects named.</p>

<p id="sec80"><b>80.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, Wm. (<i>of Norwich</i>). Historic survey
of German poetry. 8 v. 8o. 1828-30</p>

<p class="noindent">The subject-entries for a book such as this call for careful
consideration. A title-entry under “Historic” is uncalled
for, as the subject is clearly defined in the full
title. But a choice of headings must be made under
which the entries are to be given. The mind will waver
between some of these:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>German poetry.</p>

<p>Poetry, German.</p>

<p>German literature.</p>

<p>Literature, German.</p>

<p>Germany. (Sub-division Literature)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and upon a right decision hangs the usefulness and correctness
of the catalogue, as it is possible that other entries
will be affected by it later. An exact analysis shows that
the book is specifically upon the first-named subject, but
it is so clearly a part of the third-named as to be entitled
to come under it in some form, either by way of entry or
cross-reference. It is true that, if treated logically, the
book has no absolute right of inclusion under a heading
“German literature,” inasmuch as it only deals with
poetical literature, but it may be taken for granted that a
book with the title of “Historic survey of German prose”
would be placed under such a heading without much
questioning; and therefore, as concentration and convenience
count for something, and are often of more moment
than literal exactness, the entries might very well be</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>German literature.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p class="noindent">The second and fourth headings would not be chosen, for
the reason that the book is neither upon “Poetry” nor
“Literature” generally or in the abstract, and it is much
better to reserve those headings for books of that nature
or of a miscellaneous kind, putting books upon the literature
of particular countries under their distinctive name.
An inquirer wanting a book upon German literature is
more likely to turn to “German” than to “Literature.”
A general cross-reference will put the matter beyond possibility
of mistake, as</p>

the larger catalogues of reference libraries the whole of

sub-divided for convenience of reference according to the
number of entries under the heading, in divisions like

<p class="noindent">No entry is called for under “England,” unless everything
relating directly or indirectly to the home-country is to be
brought together under that heading or “Great Britain.”
If this is so, and it is to be faithfully and literally carried
out, it will become so large as to need very elaborate sub-division,
and even then, in the catalogue of a British library
at anyrate, its extent will make it of little practical value.
In large catalogues page after page would be filled to no
great advantage, and therefore the best course to adopt is
to make the entry under the exact subject, as shown,
ignoring “England” if the book deals with the country
generally and not a particular corner of it. By this plan a
book upon the “Poor of Essex” would be entered both
under “Essex” and “Poor,” but books like</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ruskin. The art of England.</p>

<p>Stephen. General view of the criminal law of
England.</p>

<p>Hobkirk. British mosses.</p>

<p>Fairholt. Costume in England.</p>

<p>Oliphant. Literary history of England.</p>

<p>Green. Short history of the English people,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">are sufficiently dealt with if, apart from the author-entry,
they appear under “Art,” “Law,” “Mosses,” “Costume,”
“English literature,” and “English history,” respectively,
leaving the headings “England” and “Great Britain” for
books <i>descriptive</i> of the country generally and not some
special aspect of it. As already shown, books upon
even special features of <i>other countries</i> should be entered
under the name of the country. In most cases it is also
desirable, even necessary, to enter under the subject likewise.
Thus the double subject-entries of books, like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Griffis. The religions of Japan.</p>

<p>Perkins. Historical handbook of Italian sculpture.</p>

<p>Gray. Birds of the West of Scotland.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">would be under “Japan” and “Religions,” “Italy” and
“Sculpture,” and “Scotland” and “Birds.” If space
cannot be afforded for both entries, judgment would then
have to be exercised in making choice of the best single
subject-heading, and it would be found that for the above
the most useful are “Japan,” “Sculpture,” and “Birds.”</p>

<p>In catalogues of the larger libraries a heading like
“Birds” would have so many items to it that it should be
sub-divided to facilitate reference, first the books upon birds
generally, followed by those upon the birds of particular
countries or localities like that above-named upon the birds
of the West of Scotland. The arrangement under the
general division would be alphabetically by authors, but it
has been found convenient to arrange the “local” by the
name of the place, also alphabetically, after this manner</p>

<p id="sec84"><b>84.</b>&mdash;The desirability, or otherwise, of using scientific
terms for subject-headings in catalogues is governed
altogether by the people for whom the library is intended.
In a library used by all classes of the community, the
simpler and more widely known term is the best, and
therefore “Birds” is preferable to “Ornithology,” “Fishes” to
“Ichthyology,” and “Insects” to “Entomology.” In a library
of a college or scientific institution the reverse method
would possibly prove the best, but it is essential that perfect
uniformity be maintained whatever form is decided upon,
as it would be somewhat ridiculous to use scientific terms
in some cases and popular names in others. The cross-reference
comes in most usefully in any style of catalogue
as it removes all doubt, thus</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ornithology. <i>See</i> Birds.</p>

</div>

<p>Catalogues compiled upon very exact lines occasionally
reserve the popular name for books of a popular or miscellaneous
nature, and the scientific for those intended for the
scientist, but the dividing line between the two classes of
books cannot always be clearly seen, and it is much better to
bring all together under the same heading, marking there any
differences in the character of the books by means of sub-division.</p>

<p>In some few instances the use of the scientific term is
unavoidable as there may be no popular name that meets
the case. For example, it would not be correct to put a
book upon the fresh-water algæ under a heading “Sea-weeds,”
and a book upon the <i>tunicata</i> cannot be put under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
any other name. The fact may be again emphasised that
in a dictionary catalogue a book is entered under its <i>definite</i>
subject and never under its class or general subject. Thus
a book like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>White, W. F. Ants and their ways,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">does not go under “Insects,” or even “Hymenoptera,” but
directly under “Ants,” though such a book as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lubbock, Sir John. Ants, bees, and wasps.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">would be sufficiently entered in the catalogue of a
scientific library, if placed under “Hymenoptera,” but in
the catalogue of a popular library should go under all three
names, “Ants,” “Bees,” and “Wasps,” just as a book like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Meyrick, E. British lepidoptera.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is better placed under “Butterflies” and “Moths” with a
cross-reference</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lepidoptera. <i>See</i> Butterflies. Moths.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It would be a waste of space, however, to enter a work so
comprehensive in character as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bath, W. H. Ants, bees, dragon-flies, earwigs,
crickets and flies.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">under each of these as, even though it omits the butterflies,
moths, and beetles, it would be well enough dealt with if
entered under “Insects.”</p>

<p>As it is a well-understood principle that a book must be
entered under the exact subject of which it treats, so a
work upon the natural history of animals while coming
within the popular notion of “natural history,” and may be
so called by its author, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lydekker, Richard (<i>Ed.</i>) The royal natural history.
Illus. 6 v. la. 8o. 1893-6</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">yet from the cataloguer’s standpoint it would not be altogether
correct to enter it under “Natural History,” as that
term is properly held to include the flora as well as fauna,
and therefore the heading should be either “Zoology” or
“Animals.” This last term is frequently reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
books dealing only with animals, and apart from birds,
reptiles, etc., and for books upon animals, not written from
the naturalist’s point of view. Correctness is again ensured
by cross-references, as</p>

<p>To give heed to details of this kind is not “hair-splitting,”
as the novice may be disposed to imagine&mdash;it is
the very essence of good cataloguing. Even with most
careful attention the cataloguer may well congratulate
himself if at the conclusion of his work, and especially
when in print, it comes out faultless, because the perfect
catalogue absolutely free from error has not yet been seen.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Intemperance the idolatry of Britain. 3rd ed.
pp. 62. sm. 8o. n.d.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">has no appearance of difficulty, as it is so obviously upon
intemperance, but the question of concentration of
books <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> upon such a subject as this must be
looked into. It is most undesirable to send an inquirer to
a number of headings to find all the books upon the
“drink question.” To effectively group them together,
developes the heading into a class rather than subject,
but even so, it has more justification than the grouping
of say “Natural history” would have, because it
is more distinctly a single subject regarded from several
standpoints, and while “temperance” cannot be “intemperance,”
yet to bring the two aspects of the question
together adds more to the utility of the catalogue than
to separate books with these words upon their title-pages
under different headings. In looking into this
matter, the subject was followed up in a good catalogue
compiled upon strictly orthodox lines, and was found up
and down under headings like Alcohol, Drink, Inebriety,
Teetotalism, Temperance, Total Abstinence, Licensed
Victuallers, Public Houses, Sunday Drinking. Most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the books under these various headings might have
been brought together with advantage under a general
term-heading like “Drink question,” with cross-references
from the other topics to bind the whole together
beyond possibility of mistake. There are other questions
that admit of concentration in this way, as for example
books upon Free Trade, Fair Trade, Reciprocity, and Protection
can all safely be entered under “Free Trade” with
references from the others.</p>

<p>Some books, on the other hand, must have several
entries, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ruddock, E. H. Modern medicine and surgery
on homœopathic principles. 1874</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">requires three entries, viz., under “Medicine,” “Surgery,”
“Homœopathy.” The only method of avoiding this would
be to enter the book under “Homœopathy,” with cross-references
from the other headings, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Medicine. <i>See also</i> Homœopathy.</p>

</div>

<p>In a small general library it would be possible to bring
together all books upon subjects so closely allied as
medicine and surgery under that heading, with a cross-reference,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Surgery. <i>See also</i> Medicine and surgery.</p>

</div>

<p>Another example of a book needing several entries, is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Garner, R. L. Gorillas and chimpanzees.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">As this is not a work upon Monkeys generally, or even
upon Apes, the correct procedure is to enter it under
“Gorillas” and “Chimpanzees” respectively, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Gorillas.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Garner, R. L. Gorillas and chimpanzees.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In a small library there would most likely be other books
upon Gorillas, but hardly a second upon Chimpanzees,
therefore the second entry would be</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Chimpanzees, Gorillas and. Garner, R. L.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">To bring this book fully under the notice of those interested
in the monkey tribe cross-references are necessary.
Presuming that there were already entries under “Monkeys”
(generally) and “Apes” (particularly), then all the
entries would be bound together by</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Monkeys.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><i>See also</i> Apes.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>See also</i> Gorillas.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">No cross-reference being called for to “Chimpanzees,” as
they are included in the title of the book under “Gorillas.”
In the event, however, of there being a second book upon
Chimpanzees, then the cross-reference becomes</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Apes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><i>See also</i> Chimpanzees. Gorillas.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p id="sec87"><b>87.</b>&mdash;At the risk of repetition, and to make the matter
clear, it may be again stated that a book must not be
entered under every important word appearing upon its
title-page. There is much rule-of-thumb cataloguing done
that would cause a book like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ihering, Rudolph von. The evolution of the
Aryan,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">to be entered under “Evolution,” whereas not even a
title-entry under the word “evolution” is required, and
the single subject-entry is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Aryans, The</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Ihering, R. von. The evolution of the Aryan.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It may be considered unnecessary advice to say that
a book so unmistakably upon the Aryan peoples should
not be put under “Evolution,” when the accepted meaning
of that term as a subject has nothing to do with it, yet
there are catalogues at present in force of important town
libraries with much worse forms. One has a heading
“Natural history,” under which there are sixteen items
that include such diverse matters as “Natural method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
curing diseases,” “Natural theology,” “Natural philosophy,”
“Nature and art,” “Drawing from nature,” because
the word “natural” or “nature” happened to occur in
the titles of the books. Another has a heading “School,
Schoolmasters, and Schools,” which includes Molière’s
“School for wives” and his “School for husbands.” Any
number of examples equally ridiculous could be quoted
from present-day catalogues to prove the contention that
this is a common form of error. Therefore the advice to
“get at the subject of the book, and never mind the particular
words used on the title-page,” cannot be too often
impressed upon the cataloguer.</p>

<p id="sec88"><b>88.</b>&mdash;Books in a number of languages dealing with a
single subject must all be entered under the English name
for that subject. Books like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Kohlrausch, F. Kurze Darstellung der deutschen
Geschichte. 1864</p>

<p>Green, S. G. Pictures from the German fatherland.
n.d.</p>

<p>Breton, J. Notes d’un étudiant français en Allemagne.
1895</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">are to be found entered in a catalogue under Deutschen,
Germany, and Allemagne, without a single binding reference.
Another has books upon the United States under
America, États-Unis, and United States. In one catalogue
there is a reference in the following form:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>États-Unis&mdash;<i>see</i> L’Univers,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which is most flattering to our American cousins. In this
connection it should be observed that references of this
kind are quite wrong. In the first place there is no occasion
for a reference or entry of any kind under “États-Unis”
in an English catalogue, and in the second the
principle of referring from a lesser to a greater subject is
incorrect; the reference must always be from a greater to
a lesser. In the same catalogue there are numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
references from subjects to authors, which are also wrong
in principle, as a reference should never be given in this
form:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">otherwise the curious humour of references of this kind
will soon show itself. In both cases entries were required

<p>1891. Gore. The incarnation. 1891</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The question is raised now and then as to whether it is
worth while giving the list of works forming a series under
the first word, other than an article, of the title of the
series instead of under some other leading word. There is
no occasion to lay down a hard and fast rule in the matter,
but all things considered, it will be found safer to treat all
series in the manner indicated and to enter them uniformly
under this first word as Great artists, Great writers,
Story of the nations, Leaders of religion, International
scientific series, under “Great,” “Story,” “Leaders,” and
“International” respectively rather than under “Artists,”
“Writers,” “Nations,” “Religion,” or “Scientific.” The
fact cannot be overlooked that the entry is only given
because it is a series-entry and not as a make-shift form
of subject-entry, and for this very reason it would be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
erroneous to enter all the series of “Great artists” under
the subject-heading “Artists” as to put the “Leaders
of religion” under “Religion.” The difficulty is fully met
by cross-references where required, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Science. <i>See also</i> International scientific series.</p>

<p>Authors. <i>See also</i> Great writers (series).</p>

<p>Scots, Famous (series). <i>See</i> Famous Scots.</p>

</div>

<p>If the series-entry is to be converted into a semi-subject
entry, it should be by the simple transposition of the title
of the series and then kept altogether apart from the
subject-heading.</p>

<p>In a library catalogue, as distinct from a bookseller’s, it is
only those series of a special and limited character that
receive entries under the names of the series, and this form
should not be extended so as to include long lists of books
in series under publisher’s names, as Weale’s series, Pitt
Press series, Macmillan’s Manuals for students. Where
very full information is given, these names may be added
to the principal entry and not carried further.</p>

<p id="sec90"><b>90.</b>&mdash;Already it has been stated that in many libraries it
is of the utmost importance that a catalogue should be
compiled with short entries and within narrow limits so as
to reduce both the size and the cost of production. To do
this judiciously does not interfere in the least with the
principles of good and adequate cataloguing, care only being
required in curtailing the entries so as not to lose their
correct character. The majority of readers in popular
libraries are little concerned with precise bibliographical
information provided they get a list of the books by the
author, or upon the subject they want. The title of Dr.
Garnett’s book mentioned above can, for example, be
shortened into entries like these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Garnett, Richard. Life of Ralph W. Emerson.
1888</p>

<p>Emerson, Ralph W.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The references from Robertson and Anderson can be
dispensed with. Shorter entries than the foregoing would
not be looked for, and would be worthless. Very brief
entries imply little or no information, as witness the
following <i>complete</i> entries from the catalogue of a large
library:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Church’s Lament.”</p>

<p>Conspiracy. Ritualistic.</p>

<p>Workhouse. Union. Bowen.</p>

</div>

<p id="sec91"><b>91.</b>&mdash;The next illustration is taken to further show the
method of regarding a book for its subject-entry:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Saintsbury</span>, George.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A history of Elizabethan literature. 1887</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This is neither a book upon literature generally nor in
the abstract, nor upon English literature as a whole, but only
upon a particular period of it. Such a book could very
properly be placed under “Elizabethan literature” with a
reference from “English literature.” It might even go
under the name of Elizabeth where all books pertaining to
her reign in every particular could be gathered, but this is
not so satisfactory. After all the most useful place for a
book of this kind would be under “English literature,” and
its inclusion could be better justified if the books under such
a heading were sub-divided, if sufficient in number, into
periods arranged chronologically as a heading like “English
History” is often usefully divided. This would necessitate
a cross-reference like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Elizabethan literature. <i>See</i> English literature.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">To further illustrate this point it may be said that a book
like</p>

<p class="noindent">The reign of Henry VIII. 2 v. 8o. 1884</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is better treated in the reverse way and entered under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
name of the monarch, in common with other books of a
strictly historical nature dealing with a particular reign. In
the first case the book is thought to be more usefully catalogued
as a contribution to the larger subject of “English
literature,” and in the second the book is looked upon as
being more particularly concerned with Henry VIII. than
with “English history”&mdash;hence the difference in the treatment.
In this last instance the safe-guarding cross-reference is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>English History.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><i>For the histories of particular reigns see under
the names of monarchs, as</i> Charles I., Henry
VIII., Victoria.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p id="sec92"><b>92.</b>&mdash;The following group is given (in brief form) in
order to show the difference of treatment of books apparently
alike in subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Farrar, F. W., <i>Dean</i> (<i>Ed.</i>) With the poets.</p>

<p>James, Henry. French poets and novelists.</p>

<p>Johnson, Samuel. Lives of the English poets.</p>

<p>Keats, John. Poetical works.</p>

<p>Shairp, J. C. Aspects of poetry.</p>

<p>Sharp, Wm. Life of Shelley.</p>

<p>Tennyson, Lord. Demeter and other poems.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The first entry would be placed under a heading “Poems,”
because it is an anthology. This heading “Poems” should
be reserved for collections of miscellaneous poems by many
authors and would not include a book like the Keats, which
should be entered under the name of the author only. It does
not require any entry under “Poetical works,” as that is simply
a form, and can no more be justified than a heading “Prose
works” could be. If, however, the book has a definite
title, like the Tennyson, then a title-entry must be given as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Demeter and other poems. Tennyson, Lord.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Librarians sometimes consider it necessary to give a series
of references under the heading “Poems” or “Poetry” to
the names of the authors represented in the catalogue, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
this is on an equality with the practice of grouping all the
fiction under a heading “Novels.” These being class-headings
are not strictly accurate but, no doubt, are a
convenience to a section of readers. So much cannot be
said for all such grouping in a dictionary catalogue, and it is
better to avoid it if possible. A catalogue of a very
important library has a heading “Essays,” under which an
attempt has been made to enter all books written in the
form of essays, as well as with the word “essay” upon the
title-pages, and the result is a mere jumble of titles, absolutely
useless, including as it does works so widely apart in
character as Baring Gould’s <i>Old country life</i>, Barrie’s
<i>Auld licht idylls</i>, Doran’s <i>In and about Drury Lane</i>, and
Lang’s <i>Books and bookmen</i>. To attempt this in a classified
catalogue would be bad enough, but in a dictionary
catalogue it shows that the first principles governing its
compilation are wholly misunderstood.</p>

<p>The book by Henry James would be fitly placed under
“French literature” and the words “poets” and
“novelists” ignored. Dr. Johnson’s book should go under
“Poets,” together with any other lives of poets in collected
form, but the life of an individual poet, like that of Shelley,
would not be so entered, as lives of individuals are entered
under their names, and not under the class to which they
belong. Shairp’s book being upon “Poetry” in the abstract
would accordingly go under that heading, as would any
book of a miscellaneous character upon poetry which could
not well be placed under a more definite subject-heading.</p>

<p id="sec93"><b>93.</b>&mdash;Sometimes in the case of biographies it will be
found unnecessary to give both author and subject-entries
because the biographies are written or edited by a son or
other relative bearing the same name, and accordingly both
entries come together in the catalogue, therefore, while
it is quite correct to give both entries, yet one suffices.
If the single entry is adopted it is better to make choice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the subject for the entry, not the author, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Stokes, William: his life and works, 1804-1878,
by his son [Sir] Wm. Stokes. (<i>Masters of
medicine.</i>) 1898</p>

</div>

<p id="sec94"><b>94.</b>&mdash;Volumes of sermons are dealt with in the same
manner as poetical works, avoiding, as far as possible, an
entry under the form “Sermons.” An illustration is</p>

<p>⸻ Sermons for the times. 1890</p>

<p>⸻ Village sermons. 1890</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The first and last of these simply require title-entries, as</p>

placed as a contribution to its subject, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Kingsley, C. The gospel of the Pentateuch:

</div>

<p class="noindent">The third and fourth will also require title-entries unless
there happens to be a general reference under the word,
“Sermons,” after this fashion</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sermons. <i>For volumes of sermons with specific
titles or upon definite subjects see those titles and

<p>(Here follows a list of the names, including Kingsley.)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If this form is not considered suitable then there is no
alternative but to give title-entries, because a heading cannot
be correctly made. The form then is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sermons. Le Bas, C. W. 2 v. 1828</p>

<p>Sermons in the East. Stanley, A. P. 1863</p>

<p>Sermons on national subjects. Kingsley, C. 2v. 1872</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The arrangement is alphabetically by the words of the
titles as in the case of any other title-entries, and not by
the names of the authors.</p>

<p id="sec95"><b>95.</b>&mdash;Dramas, Dramatic Works, are also forms calling
for similar treatment to Poems, Essays, or Sermons. Collections
of letters by individuals are simply entered under
the names of the writers with references from the editors.</p>

<p id="sec96"><b>96.</b>&mdash;There is a form of entry occasionally seen in catalogues
that is so obviously absurd that it scarcely needs to
be more than referred to, viz., a heading “Pamphlets.” Here,
presumably, all the thin or unbound books in a library are
entered. Under an arrangement of this description, work
should be facilitated, as but two headings would be requisite&mdash;one
“Books” and the other “Pamphlets”&mdash;the dividing
line between the two to be fixed by the number of pages.</p>

<p>Almost in a line with such a ridiculous heading is the lazy
cataloguer’s method of taking volumes consisting of a number
of pamphlets bound together, whether upon the self-same
subject or as many different subjects as there are pamphlets
in the volumes, and lumping them with entries like these:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Miscellaneous pamphlets. v.d.</p>

<p>Pamphlets, Miscellaneous. 37 v. v.d.</p>

<p>Sermons, Miscellaneous. v.d.</p>

<p>Political pamphlets. v.d.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Of course, each pamphlet must be dealt with in precisely
the same way as if it were a separate book, the fact that it
is a thin book not entering into the question, unless it
happens to be of so very trifling or ephemeral a character
as to be unworthy of an entry, when it should either be
withdrawn from the library (unless the fact of its being
bound up with others prevents) or properly catalogued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec97"><b>97.</b>&mdash;The prolix titles of many pamphlets, especially the
polemical tracts of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
often need abbreviation. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The succession of Solomon to the throne of
David consider’d in a sermon on the occasion of

June 18, 1727, by Thomas Bradbury. 2nd ed. 1727</p>

of the ability of elders within the province of
London. 1645</p>

<p class="noindent">Pamphlets are frequently collected and stored in libraries

<p id="sec98"><b>98.</b>&mdash;The extent to which title-entries, as distinct from
subject-entries, are called for in a dictionary catalogue has
in some measure been already shown. Works of fiction,
plays, poems, volumes of essays, and sometimes sermons,
nearly all demand such entries, they being for the most
part sought for by their titles. Examples of each of these
are</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Far from the madding crowd. Hardy, T.</p>

<p>Michael and his lost angel: a play. Jones, H. A.</p>

<p>Obiter dicta. Birrell, A. 2v. 1887-96</p>

<p>Discipline, and other sermons. Kingsley, C. 1890</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">These are apart from the title-as-subject entries, such as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Miners and their works underground. Holmes,
F. M. n.d.</p>

<p>Moravian Church, Short history of the. Hutton,
J. E. 1895.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">There are very few books outside the above classes that
really require title-entries, and, as a rule, this feature of
cataloguing is overdone. Books like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Finck, H. T. Lotos-time in Japan. 1895</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">do not require entries under “Lotos,” “My Lifetime,”
“Maid of Orleans,” or “Lectures,” besides those necessary
under “Japan,” “Hollingshead,” “Joan of Arc,” and
“English language,” yet it is quite customary to see such
entries.</p>

<p id="sec99"><b>99.</b>&mdash;It must be carefully noted that in title-entries the
articles (A, An, The) are absolutely ignored, and any other
first word is the leading word under which the entry is to
be given. It is often desirable to include the article,
especially the definite article, in such entry, when it must
be got in as soon as it can be consistent with sense and
sound, or at the end of the phrase, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Guardian angel, The. <i>Not</i> Guardian, The, angel.</p>

<p>Clyde, The, to the Jordan. <i>Not</i> Clyde to the
Jordan, The.</p>

<p>Noble life, A. <i>Not</i> Noble, A, life.</p>

<p>Evil, The genesis of. <i>Not</i> Evil, genesis of, The.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The articles are occasionally left out of such entries as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Guardian angel.</p>

<p>Clyde to the Jordan.</p>

<p>Noble life.</p>

<p>Evil, Genesis of.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but this applies only to the article preceding the first word
of the title and <i>no other</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Chariot of the flesh, The.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">cannot be correctly entered as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Chariot of flesh.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The general omission of the leading article means very
little, if any, saving of space, and has a bald effect, reading
often like the wording of a telegram. Besides losing the
clearness which its inclusion gives, it may alter the sense, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Day’s ride. <i>Is not the same as</i> Day’s ride, A.</p>

<p>Phyllis of the Sierras. <i>Is not the same as</i> Phyllis,
A, of the Sierras.</p>

<p>Soldier born. <i>Is not the same as</i> Soldier born, A.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>In transposing the article or any other leading word from
the beginning of the title the capital initial letter must be
retained, as shown in the above entries, and not in this
way,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Animal’s friend, the.</p>

<p>Priestcraft, popular history of.</p>

<p>In order to prevent a break in the alphabetical sequence,
the articles are sometimes transposed under the authors’
names, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hobbes, John Oliver.”</p>

<p>⸻ Bundle of life, A.</p>

<p>⸻ Herb-moon, The.</p>

<p>⸻ Sinner’s comedy, The.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but so little is gained by this form of entry that it hardly
compensates for the awkwardness of it.</p>

<p>It is incorrect in any form, author or title, to leave out
the article in foreign languages, and to do so can only be
justified by usage rather than exactness. As in English the
entry-word is never under the article, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p id="sec100"><b>100.</b>&mdash;Many works of fiction with proper names in their

“Mr.” “History,” “Confessions,” “Adventures,” therefore
judgment should be exercised, and either a single entry given
under the most likely place, or both title-entries given. If
space is a consideration always omit the less-known entry.
It will be seen that names in fiction are never regarded as
real names, and entries must not be given under the surnames
as “Copperfield,” “Easy,” “Lorrequer,” “Finn.”</p>

59 upon the author-entry, and no better advice can be
given to the young cataloguer than that to <i>avoid repetition
dashes wherever possible</i>, and, at most, only use them in one
of the following instances:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>a.</i> To save repeating an author’s name in author-entry

<span class="smaller">INDEXING CONTENTS.</span></h2>

<p id="sec103"><b>103.</b>&mdash;The mode of setting-out the contents of books of
a miscellaneous or collective character has been referred to in
sections 61-62 and it has been pointed out that frequently an
essay or article is more useful&mdash;even more valuable&mdash;than a
whole book, as it may give the pith of the matter it deals with,
and be sufficiently full for the needs of most people.
Under these circumstances, it is most desirable that not
only shall each subject-heading in a catalogue have all the
books in the library set out under it, but also portions of
books, within reasonable limits. How far these limits are
to extend is a nice question, and it is certainly one that
demands the consideration of English librarians, with a
view to co-operation in the production of a work upon the
lines of the <i>“A. L. A.” Index: an index to general literature,
by Wm. I. Fletcher, with the coöperation of many
librarians</i> (Boston, 1893), to fill the place for this class of
literature that Poole’s and other indexes do for periodical
literature. The “A.L.A. Index” is distinctly American,
and does not fit in so well with the collections in English
libraries, though its value cannot be gainsaid. Pending
the settlement of this question librarians must do what they
can to open up for the use of their readers the valuable
material hidden away in volumes of essays and others of a
miscellaneous character. All the rules previously laid down
for cataloguing come into application in dealing with books
of this kind, because they sometimes consist of sections by a
number of authors upon one subject, or of many authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
upon many subjects, or by a single author on many subjects.
The method usually employed of completely carrying out
this indexing is shown in the following series of examples:</p>

<p class="noindent">The sixth, seventh, and eighth entries are in title form,
upon the presumption that the library will have no other
items upon these persons or books by them. The remainder
are headings, because the probability is that there
will be other books by or upon these authors.</p>

<p>There are alternative methods of treating books of this
nature. It has already been said that the list of contents
can be omitted under the principal entry, and thereby
effect a slight saving. It would also be quite possible to
give only the title of the whole book under the subject-heading,
omitting the title of the particular essay or article, as</p>

<p class="noindent">The fact that the entry is given under Hugo would show
that there was something in the book about him, but not
that it concerned his romances only. There is also the

a whole book instead of an essay, but this difficulty could
be got over by inserting the explanatory word “essay,” as</p>

<p class="noindent">The fact that these essays are principally reviews of books
necessitates a consideration of their interest in this respect
as well as that which attaches to their value as contributions
to the subjects, and after examination it will be found
that the essays are best placed under “Dryden,”
“Symonds, J. A.”; “Chesterfield”; “Theobald, Lewis”;
and “Menander,” in this manner:</p>

into one entry in this form:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The word “contents” may be changed to “contains” or
“containing,” or even omitted altogether, as the position or
style of type would sufficiently indicate that the list was that
of the contents. Due regard being paid to the exact subject
of each of the essays, the entries would be given under
“Sonnet” (title-entry); “Germ, The”; “Hunt, Leigh”;
“Pope, Alex.”; “Buchanan, Robert”; “Hawker, Robert S.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec104"><b>104.</b>&mdash;It must be clearly understood that while there is a
certain option in indexing the contents of books like the above,
there is none whatever in dealing with collected works. That
a library happens to possess say the set of the Ashburton
edition of Carlyle’s Works does not imply that they are sufficiently
entered if set out under “Carlyle,” and therefore they
must be fully catalogued in precisely the same manner as if
each book had been purchased separately in various editions.
Under the author’s name they would be entered as shown
in the Hawthorne illustration (section 63), and each book
dealt with upon the lines already laid down, as for example</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Cromwell, Oliver.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Carlyle, T. Oliver Cromwell’s letters and
speeches elucidated. (Works, <i>Ashburton
ed.</i>, v. 6-8). 3 v. 1885-6</p>

</div>

</div>

<p id="sec105"><b>105.</b>&mdash;There is a well understood though not formulated
rule, that the contents of the great classical works do not
require indexing, and upon this principle a work, say upon
“Hamlet,” would simply be entered under “Shakespeare,”
and not even a cross-reference is needed from “Hamlet.”
So with the ancient classics. The <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Odyssey</i>, the
<i>Æneid</i>, or the <i>Agamemnon</i> are not usually entered in any
other place than under Homer, Virgil, and Æschylus respectively.
This rule would also be extended according to the
nature of the library. One that had a particular collection say
of editions of More’s <i>Utopia</i> would not require any entry under
<i>Utopia</i> further than a cross-reference to More, where all the
editions would be set out with every necessary particular.</p>

<p id="sec106"><b>106.</b>&mdash;The remarks made in section 103 upon the need
for a co-operative index to essays and the like also applies to
the need, which is probably not so much felt, for an index
to plays, and further indexes might even be looked for to
volumes of sermons arranged under subjects and texts.
More pressing still is the want of an index to the many
portraits contained in books.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE.</span></h2>

<p id="sec107"><b>107.</b>&mdash;The difference between the dictionary and classified
forms of catalogues already referred to in sections 8 and
9 may be further demonstrated by taking the two well-known
railway guides, “Bradshaw” and the “A.B.C.,”
in illustration. Both guides have merits of their own, yet
are very unlike. The “A.B.C.” will show by ready reference
and without any previous study of its arrangement,
the times of departure for and arrival at a particular railway
station, but it does not show the stoppages at intervening
stations on the journey, or supply the exhaustive information
that “Bradshaw” does. But before “Bradshaw” can
be satisfactorily used its arrangement and order must be
studied, and so it is with the classified catalogue. Its
arrangement, that is the system of classification adopted,
must first be understood, and then the order of sub-division
of the classes must be ascertained before it can be properly
used, unless such division happens to be alphabetical
rather than natural or logical. Having mastered the
classification and arrangement, the user of the classified
catalogue has the advantage of an exhaustive list of a whole
class of literature, then of a particular subject in the
aggregate and afterwards in detail, and with all its collateral
subjects brought together. That at least is the theory of
its compilation. This form has the further advantage,
already alluded to, of economy in production, as a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
seldom calls for more than a single entry other than a
reference in the index, whereas the number of entries to
each book in a dictionary catalogue is seldom less than three.</p>

<p>Again a classed catalogue can be issued in sections, a
class or more at the same time, and in large or small
editions of each section, according to the demand for them.
To be of any real service the dictionary catalogue must be
published complete, as if issued in instalments it is of no
value until completed because each section is not complete
in itself as a class-list is.</p>

<p>Having said so much for the classed catalogue, it may
be pointed out that the whole of the books contained in a
library by a particular author cannot be ascertained by it
without some trouble, unless it has a brief-title author-index
as shown in section 112, nor can the books upon a stated
country, say China, be found together in one place, those
upon the religions of China would not be grouped with
those upon its social customs, those upon its natural history
would not be with either of these, and a book dealing with
all of these together, inclusive of a description of the
country, would be in a separate place.</p>

<p id="sec108"><b>108.</b>&mdash;The arguments for and against the two styles of
catalogue being carefully weighed, more especially from
the point of view of general usefulness to the public concerned,
and with due regard to cost of production, and
choice having been made of the classified form of catalogue,
the cataloguer will first decide upon the scheme of classification
to be adopted, presuming that the library in hand is
not already classified or its system of main classes is unsatisfactory
for cataloguing purposes. This having been
accomplished by means of Brown’s <i>Manual of Library
Classification</i>, which summarises all the various systems,
the author-entry is made upon the general principles
already laid down in Chapters III. to VII. of the present
work which are all equally applicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>A line or two must be left at the top of the slip on
which the entry is written for the purpose of marking the
classification, division, and sub-division either by their
names or by numbers, if the scheme adopted has a
numerical notation. Supposing for example the book is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ward, James. Historic ornament: treatise on
decorative art and architectural ornament.
Illus. 2 v. 8o. 1897</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">the slip or card would be marked as follows on the right
hand top corner, as being the most convenient for sorting,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Fine Arts. [The class].</p>

<p>Ornament. [The division.]</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">or if the well-known Dewey Classification<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is used, the
number 745 would be written in the same place, signifying
the class “Fine Arts,” the division “Drawing, Decoration,
Design,” and the sub-division or definite subject,
“Ornamental design.”</p>

<p>Under Brown’s Adjustable Classification,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the entry
would be marked C 76, denoting the class, “Fine Arts,”
the division “Decoration,” and the sub-division “General
practice and examples.” In the dictionary catalogue this
book would be entered under “Ward” and “Ornament.”</p>

<p>Another example is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Willmott, Robt. A. (<i>Ed.</i>) The poets of the 19th
century: [selections]. pp. xx, 620, port., illus.
8o. n.d.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This would be marked “Literature,” division “English
Literature,” sub-division “Poetry,” and left for more
detailed sub-division when it comes to be arranged with
kindred works at the time of preparation for the press. The
Dewey number would be 821.08 or according to Brown’s
method of marking J 12.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A further illustration is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bird, Robert. Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth.
8th ed. pp. xii, 498. sm. 8o. 1894</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This would be marked “Theology” or “Religion,”
division “Bible,” sub-division “Christ”; the Dewey
number being 232.9, and that in Brown’s notation E168.</p>

<p id="sec109"><b>109.</b>&mdash;The next illustration is one of some difficulty,
inasmuch as it can be placed in three classes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Macpherson, H. A., A. J. Stuart-Wortley, and
Alex. I. Shand. The pheasant: natural history,
shooting, cookery. (<i>Fur and feather ser.</i>)
pp. x, 265, illus. 1895</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Having regard to the series in which the book appears, it
cannot very well be placed under “Natural History,” nor
is there much contained in it that appeals to the scientific
naturalist, though a reference from the division “Game
birds” in that class would be most desirable. As the
pheasant has first to be shot before it can be cooked, and
there are many more pages devoted to the shooting than
to the cooking, the book is placed among sporting books:
class “Fine Arts,” division “Recreative Arts,” sub-division
“Field Sports,” further division “Shooting.” The Dewey
number is accordingly 799, and the Brown mark C632.</p>

<p>In the dictionary catalogue a book like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bernard, Henry M.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The apodidæ. (<i>Nature ser.</i>) pp. xx. 316, illus.
sm. 8o. 1892</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is readily dealt with, as it is simply entered under “Apodidæ”
for the subject. In the classified catalogue, however,
it must be worked out to its full limits, as class
“Science,” section “Natural History,” division “Zoology,”
sub-division “Arthropoda” or “Articulata,” lesser division
“Crustacea.” The Dewey number is 595.3, and the Brown
notation is A152.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon a like principle, a book upon a very different
subject, viz.,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Loftie, W. J.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Westminster Abbey. New ed., revised, pp. xii,
319, illus. 8o. 1891</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is treated in the same manner. The class is “History,” the
division “Europe,” sub-division “British Isles,” further
division “England,” and lesser division “London”; the
Dewey number being 942.1, and that of Brown is F742.
This arrangement is upon the presumption that the book
is written from the historical and topographical standpoint.
It is, however, written as much from the architectural point
of view, and the heading might be entirely different; as
then the class would be “Fine Arts,” the division “Architecture,”
and the sub-division “Ecclesiastical Architecture,”
with a further section devoted to “Monographs.” This is
one of those books of a composite character that can be
very suitably placed in two classes, so far as the catalogue
is concerned, as against shelf arrangement.</p>

<p>Even in cataloguing it is unusual and not easy to split
up into classes and sub-divisions those books of a miscellaneous
character, as volumes of essays, which are
“indexed” section by section in the dictionary catalogue.
These, therefore, are brought together in one place, unless
the whole or the greater number of the essays or sections
are upon a particular subject, when they are placed in their
proper class. Though there may be no division of the
contents of miscellaneous books, as distinct from collected
works, this in no wise obviates the necessity for setting
out in full the <i>contents</i> of such books in the entry under
the main class. Apart from the little difficulty and it not
being customary, there is no very sufficient reason why
these contents should not be split up in classified
cataloguing and inserted in the proper classes throughout,
even as they would be treated to subject-entries in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
dictionary catalogue; indeed, fairly looked at, it is the
only right method of procedure to adopt.</p>

<p>The under-mentioned books are grouped together
because they are all comprised in the single class of
“History” under the Dewey classification. By the Brown
method “Biography and Correspondence” is separated
from “History and Geography” and made into another
class, though it is often very difficult to find the dividing
line between history and biography in the lives of monarchs
and other historical memoirs. The classes and divisions
are given to each item in the form which it is advised that
the catalogue slips should be marked for sorting until the
time arrives for them to be prepared for printing.</p>

<p id="sec110"><b>110.</b>&mdash;As already pointed out, the principal difficulty
with classified catalogues, more especially if the classification
is extended to its fullest limits, is that persons using
the catalogue must familiarise themselves with its arrangement
before they can make an adequate use of it. Thus to
find a book upon Russia, the geographical order has to be
thought out, and to find a life of Sterne it must first be
remembered that as he was an author he will come into the
literary division of biography, or if a life of William Penn
is wanted, it must be found out whether it is placed in
the biography of religion or of history according to the
point of view from which it is regarded.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown’s system removes some of these difficulties,
as he for the most part arranges his countries alphabetically
under continents, and his biographies of individuals altogether
alphabetically by the subjects. In some recent
classified catalogues this idea has been carried further, and
all continents and countries of the world arranged in one
alphabet, as Abyssinia, Afghanistan, Africa, Algeria, Asia,
and so on with such suitable sub-division under each as may
be called for. This alphabetical arrangement has also been
carried out under the main divisions of the classes “Fine
Arts” and “Useful Arts,” and it certainly facilitates reference,
though it must be admitted that it breaks away from
the important principle of giving a complete view of a
subject in all its bearings, first generally, then in particular
down to its finest limits. This principle may very well be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
waived in dealing with <i>individual</i> biography, and in such
case the form of entry would be reversed, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Biography.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sterne, Laurence, The life of, by Percy
Fitzgerald. Port. 2 v. sm. 8o. 1896</p>

<p>By the Dewey system works of fiction fall into place
under languages, epochs, and authors in the main class
“Literature” as they should, but most libraries have to
make a separate class for this kind of literature. This
has been allowed for in the Brown Adjustable Classification,
the arrangement being alphabetically by authors with a
separate section of books for juveniles, this being further
divided for books specially written for boys and again for
books for girls. These two main divisions of works of
fiction (<i>i.e.</i> novels) and story books for children will be
found sufficient in cataloguing, the entries being alphabetically
by authors. The dictionary principle of a title-entry
may be added with advantage, and the titles given
either in separate alphabetical order or more conveniently
in their place in the same alphabet with the author-entries, of
course keeping all the entries together in their particular class.</p>

<p id="sec111"><b>111.</b>&mdash;The more elaborate the classification in a classified
catalogue the more need there is for an adequate
index to authors and subjects. The index may be a simple
reference under the author’s name to the page upon which
the entry is to be found, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ward, James 130</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but this necessitates a hunt from page to page, and almost
from line to line on each page if the author has written a
number of books which appear in different parts of the
catalogue. For example, this is the index-entry to a
catalogue so indexed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hamerton, P. G., 42, 84, 86, 119, 125, 149, 151,
163, 165, 174, 175, 176, 190, 213, 215, 252,
330, 366.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The only method of obviating this is to give a brief title of
each book, just sufficient to identify it, and while it must
be admitted this method takes up some space, yet it is
worth it. The following is the form referred to:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hamerton, P. G. Drawing and engraving, 86.</p>

<p>⸻ French and English, 119.</p>

<p>⸻ Human intercourse, 42.</p>

<p>⸻ Modern Frenchmen, 149.</p>

<p>⸻ Thoughts about art, 84.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The same difficulty would not arise in indexing subjects
because the whole subject would be grouped in one place
or almost so, and reference to the page or pages would be
easy enough. An example of this subject-index entry
taken from the same catalogue is</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>France (History), 124, 126, 136.</p>

<p>⸻ (Descriptive) 215.</p>

<p>⸻ The Church in, 139.</p>

<p>⸻ Language and Literature, 246, 280.</p>

<p>Franco-German War, 136.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">With the Dewey and Brown notations the indexing would
be by class and topic number, and not by pages, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ornament, 745.</p>

<p>Poetry, English. 821.</p>

<p>Christ, Lives of. E 168.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Irrespective of the system of classification made use of
each separate section of a class could be numbered
consecutively for indexing purposes (as this present book
is) and unless the sections were unusually large, reference
would thereby be much simpler and more direct than by the
page.</p>

<p>If the section or class of prose fiction were arranged
under authors alphabetically, there would be no occasion to
include the authors of that section in the index, and a mere
general statement at the commencement of the index,
pointing to the fact that they were not so included would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
meet the case. Upon a similar principle it would hardly be
necessary to index the <i>subjects</i> of individual biography if
they were arranged alphabetically as suggested, though it
must be remembered that many of these would appear in
the index as authors.</p>

<p>It is customary to keep the author and subject-indexes
separate, sometimes printing one at the beginning and the
other at the end of the catalogue. There does not seem to
be any important reason for adopting this course, and both
indexes might very well be amalgamated, and so add one
feature of the dictionary form to the classified catalogue,
besides it would be easier to refer to. In no case should
a summary of the classification adopted, showing the order
of its arrangement, be omitted, and this is better placed at
the beginning than at the end where the index will be.</p>

<p>The index entries can be made, if desired, at the time
of writing the main entry for the catalogue, when a smaller-sized
slip should be used for them; but it is found convenient
to compile the index from the printer’s proofs as
the work passes through the press. With the Dewey and
Brown numbering there is no occasion to wait until the
work is so far advanced, and the index can be as easily compiled
before any portion of the “copy” is sent to the
printer as when it is in type.</p>

<p id="sec112"><b>112.</b>&mdash;It may be necessary to add that the main entries
of a classified catalogue are arranged by class and topic
names or numbers, as shown in the examples, and not by
authors, as in the dictionary catalogue, though the authors
of books coming together under a single definite topic
would be arranged alphabetically as a matter of course.</p>

<span class="smaller">ALPHABETISATION AND ARRANGEMENT.</span></h2>

<p id="sec113"><b>113.</b>&mdash;On the face of it, it seems a simple affair to arrange
slips in alphabetical order&mdash;“as easy as a, b, c”&mdash;but,
judging by the mistakes made, and the small number of
persons who when put to it can alphabetise properly, it is
not so simple as it appears. The arrangement is, of course,
to be according to the English alphabet, and irrespective
of the language of the entries, I and J and U and V to be
kept apart as distinct letters, and then by each separate
word.</p>

<p>One of the first principles is to arrange all entries
leading off with the same word in accordance with what is
understood as precedence and importance of entry, viz.,
(1) author and other personal names; (2) subject names;
(3) titles of books; as, for example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ireland, Alex. (<i>Ed.</i>) The book-lover’s enchiridion.</p>

<p class="center">(Author.)</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ireland.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bagwell, R. Ireland under the Tudors.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">(Subject.)</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ireland: a tale. Martineau, H.</p>

<p class="center">(Title.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been shown that initial letters precede all
words with the same initial, and under the same rule all
names with a particular initial for the Christian name are
placed before those with the Christian name in full, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Fitzgerald, P. F.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, Percy.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, S. J. A.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, Samuel.</p>

</div>

<p>Where there are a number of persons of the same surname
and initial in the catalogue it is as well, for the sake
of clearness, to try and find out the full name for which
the initial stands and give it. When this cannot be done
it is very important to take care and not attribute books
by different authors to one, or by an individual to different
authors. These are mistakes much more commonly made
than might be supposed.</p>

<p>Monarchs, as authors or as subjects, having similar
names are arranged in chronological order, but with
British sovereigns leading, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>William I., the Conqueror.</p>

<p>William III., Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>William IV.</p>

<p>William II., Emperor of Germany.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">These would be followed by persons with a single name, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>William <i>of Malmesbury</i>,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and then by other persons with William as a surname,
arranged in order alphabetically by their Christian names
or initials. When titles are used and appear in the name,
as Lord, Lady, Sir, Rev., Dr., they are ignored and not
allowed to affect the arrangement in the least, not even if it
happens that there is no other means of distinguishing a
person, and if the Christian name cannot be ascertained
such a name would be placed before that of all others
of the same name and treated in precisely the same way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
if the surname only were known and no title existed, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lamb, Lady.</p>

<p>Lamb, Arthur.</p>

<p>Lamb, Charles.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If two noblemen of the same title have the same Christian
name they should be placed in order of succession with
their order shown, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Derby, Edward, 14th Earl of.</p>

<p>Derby, Edward, 15th Earl of.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and parents and children with similar names are arranged
according to seniority, like</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dumas, Alexandre.</p>

<p>Dumas, Alexandre, <i>fils</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is sometimes recommended to place distinctions of this
nature with the surname, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Johnson <i>senior</i>, Thomas.</p>

<p>Johnson <i>junior</i>, Thomas.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but this is not a very happy form.</p>

<p>Names of a person in different forms must not be
alphabetised under those forms, but one selected and all
concentrated under it, as it would be foolish to have
separate entries under say Shakspere, Shakespeare,
Shakspear, Shakspeare, though the variety in the name can
be shown <i>in the different entries</i> under the form adopted.</p>

<p id="sec114"><b>114.</b>&mdash;It has already been shown that different editions
of the same work are to be arranged in order of publication
as far as possible, and that editions in the language of
the original are placed before translations, and complete
works before parts or selections. These would in turn be
followed by works <i>upon</i> the author as subject, <i>i.e.</i>, biographical
and critical, when there is no occasion to repeat
his name as a subject-heading, as the repeat dash may be
omitted to show that he is not the author of a book upon
himself, a mistake that is not likely to be made by the
dullest person if the name of the author of the book upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the author in question leads off, thus</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lamb, Charles. The essays of Elia.</p>

<p>⸻ Mrs. Leicester’s school.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ainger, A. Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>Martin, B. E. In the footprints of Lamb.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This order of arrangement may be tabulated in full in this
way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1st. Complete works in the original (by date of
publication).</p>

<p>2nd. Complete works in translation (by date of
publication).</p>

<p>3rd. Semi-complete works (<i>i.e.</i> more than a
single work).</p>

<p>4th. Single works, arranged alphabetically by
titles, first in the original, and then translations
of each immediately following.</p>

<p>5th. Works where the author is a joint-author.</p>

<p>6th. Works when he is only editor or compiler.</p>

<p>7th. References <i>from</i> the person as <i>author</i>.</p>

<p>8th. Works relating to him, alphabetically by
authors.</p>

<p>9th. References <i>from</i> the person as <i>subject</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">As already stated in section 52, names with prefixes are taken
as part of the name, and arranged accordingly. If the prefix
is abbreviated as M’, or Mc, or St., it is placed in order as if
spelled out Mac or Saint. This does not imply that the
name must be so altered in the catalogue, and refers to the
order only. Names like Müller should be arranged as
Muller, taking care that other entries are not under Mueller,
but this is a matter that can be best dealt with according to
the circumstances of the case, as, for instance, Goethe
should be so alphabetised, and not as Göthe. Diphthongs
are alphabetised as separate letters.</p>

<p id="sec115"><b>115.</b>&mdash;Abbreviated words in title-entries are also treated
as if given in full, and consequently “Dr. Thorne” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
“Mr. Isaacs” do not come immediately before “Drab”
and “Mud,” but with “Doctor” and “Mister” respectively.
It need hardly be said that “Mrs. Bligh” or any other
Mrs. is not alphabetised in either the abbreviated or
colloquial form, but as “Mistress,” and therefore does not
come between “Mozley” and “Muddock.” Other abbreviated
words are arranged upon the same plan. “Fo’c’s’le
yarns” appearing as “Forecastle,” though the exception to
this rule is found in other elisions contained in such
entries, as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>’Twas in Trafalgar’s Bay.</p>

<p>’Tween snow and fire.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Who was Philip?</p>

<p>Who’s to blame?</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which are alphabetised as here shown, and not under “It,”
“between,” or “Who is.”</p>

<p>Compound words, whether divided by a hyphen or
printed as one word, are arranged to follow the single word,
after this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Book for the hammock.</p>

<p>Book of nonsense.</p>

<p>Bookbinding.</p>

<p>Book-buying.</p>

<p>Book-keeping.</p>

<p>Book-plates.</p>

<p>Books.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>New South Wales.</p>

<p>New Testament.</p>

<p>New Zealand.</p>

<p>Newcastle.</p>

<p>Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Newgate.</p>

</div>

<p>When numerals lead off in a title-entry they are alphabetised
as if written or printed in words; thus</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>£1,000,000 bank-note, The.</p>

<p>97th Regiment, History of the.</p>

<p>£200 reward.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">are put in order as, “One million,” “Ninety-seventh,” and
“Two hundred” respectively.</p>

<p id="sec116"><b>116.</b>&mdash;It is necessary to repeat the instructions to ignore
the articles “A,” “An” and “The” in alphabetical
arrangement, when they lead in a title or are transposed for
alphabetical purposes, but not otherwise. In the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a title they must be reckoned with, and therefore “Under
a strange mask” comes before “Under Drake’s flag,” and
“Mr. and Mrs. Faulconbridge” before “Mr. Baker’s
money.” The possessive is to be treated as spelled, and so
“Miners and their works” comes before “Miner’s right,
The,” and “Boys’ and Girls’ Book of Games” comes
between “Boys’ adventures” and “Boys and I.”</p>

<p>Sometimes entries upon quite different subjects, which
are spelled alike are, in the work of sorting, inadvertently
amalgamated under a single heading, and so books like
“<i>The Great Seals of England</i>” by Wyon; “<i>Seals of the
British Seas</i>” by Southwell; and “<i>Catalogue of seals in the
British Museum</i>” by Birch, are brought together to the
confusion of the naturalist or the antiquarian. Fortunately
there are not many such subjects, or the rule-of-thumb
mechanical cataloguer would oftener create laughter than
he now does.</p>

<p>Occasionally it will be found advisable to ignore the
alphabetical order of the titles of the books under an
author’s name, as in the case where a number of books
with varying titles are intended to be read in a particular
order when it is of more advantage to so arrange them than
to adhere to the alphabetical order. A note should be
added, stating that the arrangement is according to
sequence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">PRINTING.</span></h2>

<p id="sec117"><b>117.</b>&mdash;The slips being sorted into alphabetical order if a
dictionary catalogue, or into classes and divisions if a classified
catalogue, are to be laid down on sheets of paper to
send to the printer. These sheets of paper should be thin,
tough, and uniform in size, but the colour and quality is of
little importance and brown or cheap printing paper will do.
The slips are first prepared by cutting away any part of the
entry not to be printed, as the author’s name from the
second and subsequent entries under his name, and in the
same way cutting off the subject-heading from those slips
where there are more entries than one under the subject.
This is better than laying all down, and then afterwards
marking out what is not to be printed. The sheets of
paper should be first pasted all over, the slips laid upon
them in order, usually in two columns, and then all pressed
over. A little marginal space should be left for the insertion
of additional entries.</p>

<p>If the entries are written upon cards, and it is wished to
avoid the work of laying them down on sheets of paper, the
names and headings not to be printed should be scored
through, and the cards strung together in batches of a
hundred or so by means of the hole usually perforated in
them, numbering them through from beginning to end for
order and safety. If the “copy” consists of the printed
pages of a former catalogue with new additions to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
inserted, the page should first be laid down on the sheet
and the new entries below, these being numbered consecutively
on each sheet separately with a corresponding
number marked upon the page at the exact place where the
new entry goes. Should there be a comparatively large
number of such insertions, it is a much safer plan and
fairer to the printer to cut up the printed page and place
the additional entries in their correct order before laying
them down on the sheet of paper.</p>

<p id="sec118"><b>118.</b>&mdash;The sheets as they are got ready must be consecutively
numbered throughout with a bold figure on the right
hand top corner, and before sending them to the printer
they should be finally looked through for revision. This is
the most convenient time for marking the “copy,” for
variations in type. The marking is usually as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For CAPITALS underline three times in black ink.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Small Capitals</span> underline twice in black ink.</p>

<p>For <i>Italics</i> underline once in black ink.</p>

<p>For <b>Clarendon</b> or other heavy type underline as
above in red.</p>

<p>For <span class="smaller">smaller type</span> than the body of the catalogue
mark the portions down the margin in red and
black, or red and blue.</p>

</div>

<p>Before the catalogue can be sent to be printed, its form
must be decided upon as to the size of pages, quality and
colour of paper, the types to be used, and the style of
binding, and these being settled, a specification must be
prepared to guide the printer in his work, or to obtain
tenders upon if the work of printing is open to competition,
as is most usual with all work done for public bodies.
Personal preferences govern many matters in connection
with the “get up” of a catalogue, though in most instances
there is a limit imposed by the necessity for economy in
cost of printing, just as there so often is for economy of
compilation. The styles ordinarily adopted in the catalogues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the lending departments of the rate-supported libraries
may be referred to.</p>

<p id="sec119"><b>119.</b>&mdash;The most economical and commonest form is royal
octavo in size, printed with two columns on the page in
brevier type, with the subject-headings in a heavier type,
and notes and list of contents in nonpareil. Sometimes
the authors’ names in the principal entry are printed in
capitals and small capitals, and this serves very well for
distinctive purposes. Occasionally a catalogue is seen in
which the subject-headings are in capitals and the authors’
names printed in heavier type, with the result that the
authors are too prominent and the subjects not prominent
enough. If the authors’ names in all entries are printed
in blacker type and the shelf or other finding numbers as
well, the appearance is greatly marred, the page having a
spotted look most unrestful to the eye, and the purpose for
which the heavy type is adopted is defeated. Altogether it
will be found that the heavier type to be effective must be
used sparingly, and as subject-headings are much less
numerous than authors’ names, the most dignified and
satisfactory page is obtained by the use of heavier type for
the headings rather than for the authors’ names. While
this refers mainly to the dictionary catalogue, it is also the
best style to adopt for the classified catalogue. All type
used should be as plain as possible, either old or modern-faced,
without fancy letters, and the heavier type should be
similar in style and size to that used in the body of the
catalogue. When two sizes of type are used for distinctive
purposes, it is customary to pass over a size in order that
the distinction may be clearer, thus if the body type were
long primer, the contents and notes should be set in
brevier and not bourgeois, and nonpareil should be used
with brevier, and not minion. The following specimens
of types will be found useful, especially as it shows the line
space occupied by each size:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<p class="center">SIZES OF TYPE.</p>
<img src="images/type-sizes.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p id="sec120"><b>120.</b>&mdash;Another style of catalogue often seen is demy
octavo in size, printed across the page in long primer with
“Clarendon” or “De Vinne” subject-headings and brevier
notes and contents. This is a very effective form for a
class-list or for the first catalogue of a new library, as it has
the advantage of giving an imposing appearance to the catalogue,
no matter how poor the collection of books is. Of
course it is much easier to read and altogether gives a
better page, but it adds considerably to the bulk and cost
of the catalogue, besides giving the printer more “fat,” as
the white or unprinted portions of the page are called.
This style is preferable for the reference library, where the
size of the catalogue is unimportant, as it has not to be
carried about.</p>

<p>There are variations from these sizes and types ranging
from a super royal octavo and crown quarto down to
duodecimo, with type from small pica to nonpareil. The
number of copies in the edition depends upon the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or probable number of purchasers of the catalogue during a
given term of years, local circumstances alone deciding in
this matter.</p>

<p id="sec121"><b>121.</b>&mdash;Before sending out a specification for printing
estimates, it is a safer, more satisfactory, and fairer plan to
all concerned to have a specimen page set up, containing
in it all the types to be used in something near their proportionate
quantities. The cost of such a page is trifling,
but the librarian then knows precisely what he is asking
for and what to expect, and the printer better understands
what he is tending for. All other points it is thought are
included in the following illustrative specification, which is
not taken from that of any particular library, but embodies
concisely what are considered to be the best features of
several specifications.</p>

pages each per week until completed, or in
default thereof the printer to pay a sum of two
pounds per week as damages.</p>

<p><i>Proofs.</i>&mdash;Two copies of proof in galley and two copies

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John E. Burkett</span>, <i>Librarian</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p id="sec122"><b>122.</b>&mdash;The printer and price having been fixed a supply
of “copy” is sent and in due time proofs in “galley,”
<i>i.e.</i> in long columns before the matter is “broken up” into
pages, are received. The first proofs will not comprise the
title-page, preface, and other preliminary pages, which are
invariably printed last though first in order when the work
is completed, and therefore the copy for this part of the
catalogue need not be sent to the printer until the work is
nearing its completion. The manuscript or other “copy”
will be returned with the proofs and should be carefully
and clearly read aloud by some qualified person to the
cataloguer, who will correct the proofs by marking the
corrections on the margin. When the proofs in hand have
been so read over, it is advisable for the cataloguer to again
read them carefully through apart from the copy before
returning to the printer, as it is a much simpler matter to
correct in galley than in page. At this point any additions
to be inserted must be given, as they cannot be added to
proofs in page without very great trouble, entailing the upsetting
of work done, and consequently delay. The proofs
after being fully corrected, will be returned by the printer
with a clean proof (or “revise” as a proof after correction
is termed) in page when all the corrections marked on the
galley must be compared with the entries or the revise, to
see that they have been properly attended to. At this time
the headings, catch words, and numbering of the pages must
be checked, and when the entries under a subject-heading
have been divided by the end of a page or column the
repeated headings upon the next column or page must be
carefully examined. When books under an author’s name
are so divided, his name should be repeated in the same
way at the top of the next column or page.</p>

<p>These being attended to, the whole sheet should again be
read through before finally sending it to press, and even
with the care already expended, it is remarkable how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mistakes will then be discovered for the first time. If the
corrections in page are somewhat numerous, or if any doubt
exists as to their receiving proper attention, or a particular
correction is one of some moment, it is as well to have
another “pull” of the sheet when corrected, and make
quite certain before marking it to “go to press.”</p>

<p id="sec123"><b>123.</b>&mdash;In correcting proofs there are other mistakes to
look for besides the misspelling, misplacing, or omission of
words. It is of the utmost importance that the numbers or
other marks whereby the books are asked for or found
should be as correct as possible, as mistakes of this kind
lead to vexation both on the part of the readers and
officials. Attention is also required to the proper dividing
of words in turning over lines, the use of letters of the right
fount of type as others get sorted in, and if not changed
mar the look of the page when printed, the removal of
broken letters, the correct guage for indents and parts
“standing clear,” the removal of quadrats or space pieces,
so that they do not stand up in evidence on the printed
page, and other items of this nature. The column of
catalogue matter given in <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a> has most of the
errors usually made upon it with the signs used in correcting
it, and is accompanied by explanations of them. The
corrections are to be marked in the margins as shown in
the specimen, and not upon the printed matter, else they
will be overlooked. The same page as corrected is given.</p>

<p>If after due attention to all these details the cataloguer
is enabled to produce a work free from blemish of compilation
or printing he may heartily congratulate himself,
though the public who use the library having such a
catalogue will even then not fully appreciate the care and
anxiety expended on it, and will soon after prove this by
asking when “a new one will be out.”</p>

turn out wrong when the work is in type and the tendency is to
overstate the number of pages, when the printer is within his
rights, according to trade usages, in claiming for profit upon the
full number of pages upon which his estimate was based, therefore
it is better to have a saving clause as well as to leave a safe
margin on the lesser side when calculating the number of pages.</p>

catalogue of an average general library, with references and

<p class="center"><i>The Life of a Card Catalogue never ends. Additions can
be made at any time, and in any place.</i></p>

<p>In all libraries, whether private or public, the Card Catalogue is
an essential. In a large public library, where the stock of books
is being constantly added to, it is necessary, in order to save a weary
search through pages of MSS. and numerous printed supplements
to have a complete index on cards carefully kept up-to-date, where
the public or the staff can readily ascertain by one reference whether
any particular book is in the library. In the reference library the
necessity of the Card Catalogue cannot be questioned. To print a
catalogue of the reference library is an expensive proceeding, as the
sales seldom reach one-tenth part of the cost; and frequently the
printed catalogue suffers in usefulness by the need of keeping it within
certain limits.</p>

<p>We recommend the “Libraco” Tray Cabinets for use in
Libraries, as they divide up a catalogue into many parts, and allow
several persons to consult the Catalogue at one time.</p>

<h3>“LIBRACO” TRAY CABINETS.</h3>

<p>The enormous advantages of the Card Indexing System for Libraries
are beyond question. The only disadvantage alleged against the system
is that only a limited number of people can consult the card catalogue
at one time. The Cabinet illustrated on this page holds 18,000 cards,
and is suitable for a library of 6,000 volumes. The Cabinet therefore
divides the catalogue into 15 parts and allows 15 persons to use it.
The trays are removable and may be carried to a counter for consultation.
In a reference library it is seldom that at any given time during
the day more than three or four people are desirous of consulting the
catalogue, therefore the one and only disadvantage alleged against the
Card System is imaginary. A properly guided Card Catalogue is
easier to handle than the MSS. book. Stout cards and perfect
arrangement render consultation a pleasure.</p>

<h3>“LIBRACO” SLIDE CABINETS.</h3>

<p>The “Libraco” Slide Cabinets are thoroughly constructed of
oak, mahogany or walnut throughout. They are provided with
extension slides, which prevent the drawer coming out entirely,
but allow it to pull out to the full extent. A full view of the
contents is thus obtained. Every detail has been carefully considered
and worked out, so that a loaded drawer runs noiselessly
and with ease. Built in various sizes.</p>

<h4>THE BEST ENGLISH LINEN CARDS.</h4>

<p>The material from which these cards are cut is manufactured
by an English Mill to the order of the Library Supply Co. It is
prepared expressly to meet the requirements of the Card System,
and is not carried in stock by any Paper Merchant. The
“Libraco” Index Cards are exact in height and the edges will
be found true and square. The machinery for cutting these
cards has been specially adapted for the purpose.</p>

<p>The “Libraco” Index Cards are made in three weights,
thin, medium, and thick. The thin cards are mostly used
because they occupy less space, and therefore reduced the cost
of storage. But in all important indexes, medium and thick
cards are adopted.</p>

<h3>ADJUSTABLE SHEAF CATALOGUES.</h3>

<p>For certain index purposes these sheaf binders are admirably
suited, and appeal to those in favour of the book form of
cataloguing. The sheaf catalogues are in the form of screw
binders, which hold loose slotted slips. The slips can be
arranged alphabetically and maintained in strict order. The
screws are turned by means of a key, and thus release contents,
when insertions or withdrawals can be made. When screwed
up the slips are clamped firmly, and it is impossible to remove
or tear out an entry without leaving a counterfoil.</p>

<h3>LIBRARY AND MUSEUM NUMBERS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Gold Blocked Numbers and Letters on Leatherette.</i></p>

<p>These numbers and letters are easily and permanently affixed to
the backs of books by means of fish glue, and whilst they cost less
than one-sixth of the sum charged by a bookbinder, they are, in the
opinion of many librarians, better and more effective than numbering
direct on to the books, as the contrast between the colour of the
leatherette and the colour of the binding emphasises the number.
Besides cheapness, they are time savers, as new books can be numbered
as purchased. Their neat and uniform appearance are pleasing
recommendations, and sufficient to warrant the discarding of the
unsightly draper’s labels commonly used.</p>

<p class="caption">Simplest, Cheapest and Best.</p>
</div>

<p>Shelf Label Holders are useful in every library, especially
in libraries where books are classified on the shelves. Our
Label Holders are made of japanned metal, having a long
flange which rests on the shelf. The edges of the holder are
so turned that they hold a stout card bearing the name of
subject or author. This card may be removed or renewed at
pleasure. Where desired, transparent slips, to cover the cards
and protect them from dust, are supplied at an extra charge.
Card Labels are supplied free with our holders. Hundreds of
these holders are now in use, and have practically demonstrated
their usefulness and many advantages. They take the place
of the unsightly labels of many colours and shapes hitherto
pinned to the shelves, which were so detrimental to the
woodwork.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
